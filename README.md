## Balance
- Sweets Simple Settings - Adjusts various gameplay settings to provide a more difficult and hardcore experience. Modifications include damage, health, AP, carry weight, crippled limb penalties, dismemberment, skill tags, and vendor respawn timing.
- Harder Barter Faster Stronger (Sicko Mode) - Rebalances the economy around the barter skill, functionally creating a much more punishing economy.
- Bullet Time - Utilized in Uranium Fever to completely supplant VATS, Bullet Time is a robust, AP-based, time-scaling function with an emphasis on careful player aim and thoughtful decision making.
- Armor Damage Overhaul - Replaces the nonsensical base game armor degradation system with a design that is highly customizable and markedly more intuitive.
- New Blood - A complete reconstruction and rebalancing of damage in its entirety. New Blood adds new features, such as bleeding effects when struck by bladed weapons and formula based knockdown when hit by blunt weapons or shotgun shots.
- Famine - A loot scarcity mod that punishes poor resource management habits and forces the player to engage with the barter and crafting systems.
- RAD - Radiation Is Actually Dangerous - A hardcore overhaul of radiation, dehydration, hunger, and sleep deprivation, making these effects considerably more impactful.
- Sweet Consumables - A top-to-bottom reconstruction of consumables and miscellaneous items with a focus on deliberate and thoughtful balance.
- Aid Addon - Adds 16 new, hardcore focused healing items and new survival healing options.
- Sweet Healing Systems - A comprehensive overhaul and rebalancing of doctors, sleep, endurance, infirmary based healing and radiation removal, doctor radiation removal, radiation dispersal over time, infirmary detox, and addiction removal.
- SPARE (Sweet Part and Ammo Rebalance and Expansion) - A complete rebalancing of the ammo crafting system, with cohesive breakdown recipes, battery-based energy cell recharging, explosives crafting and breakdown, added ammo types, a consistent ammo naming scheme, a transition to vendor carried boxes of ammo, and general ammo-centric economy improvements.
- SWEEP (Sweet Weapon Enhancement and Expansion Package) - A complete rebalance of weapons intended to create a cohesive and balanced system with more gradual weapon progression.
- Sweet Dynamic Detection System - Enhances NPCs ability to detect the player at longer distances, functionally nerfing sniping.
- Simple AI Merge - A long-term collection of AI improvements made by one of the game’s leading engine experts. This mod makes combat far more engaging.
- Immersive Recoil 2.0 - Adds realistic recoil to guns, making combat far more challenging.
- Immersive Recoil NPC - Adds a recoil-like mechanic to NPCs, greatly improving the flow of combat.
- Weapon Jamming Tweaks - Adjusts weapon jamming to foster a more hardcore experience. Fixes several jam related bugs, and adds a new jam clearing function.
- STARS (Sweet's Total Armor Rework System) - A comprehensive rebalancing of the entire armor suite. Also seamlessly integrates a large collection of the best modded armor retextures and additions.
- Titans of the New West - A complete reimagining and retexturing of power armor to achieve a much more heavy and imposing aesthetic. Also including many new features, animations, and sound effects.

## Functions
- Bad Touch - Adds realistic consequences to exposure to environmental hazards, such as fire, electricity, cacti, broken glass, toxic sludge pools, poisonous gas, and radioactive goo.

- Armed to the Teeth Redux - Allows the player to holster 4 weapons on their body simultaneously.
- Forced Entry - Allows the player to bypass locks by attacking them. This forces the player to choose between using different scarce resources (lockpicks, ammo, or melee weapon condition) to open locks.
- Universal Water Bottling - Allows the player to fill empty bottles from any water source. This facilitates harsher dehydration consequences while also adding extra resource availability to ameliorate said needs.
- Immersive Minigames - Real-time, character-skill based replacements for hacking and lockpicking, with an emphasis on resource management. Allows for skipping the redundant lockpicking and hacking minigames in favor of holding a hotkey with pre-determined odds of success. This mod generally decreases minigame success rates, making associated resources more impactful.
- Simple Night Vision - Integrates high-quality, balanced night vision and thermal vision to select headgear.
- B42 Quickthrow - Adds a new, modernized weapon throwing mechanic, further promoting the use of throwables.
- Purchase Items on Display - Allows purchase of items directly off of shelves in shops, rather than bartering directly with vendors.
- B42 Optics - Seamlessly adds dual-rendered scopes into the game.
- B42 True Learning - Adds contextual lean when aiming out from corners.

## Comprehensive Overhauls
- Functional Post Game Ending - Adds a functional post-game world, fully fleshed out with the consequences of your actions. You will no longer be brought straight to the credits after beating the game.

- Mojave Raiders - A complete overhaul and diversification of the many Raider factions of the Mojave Wasteland.
- AGE (Anchorage Gameplay Expansion) - A complete overhaul of the Anchorage DLC, including rebalancing, new gear, weapons, enemies, encounters, and boss fights. Heavily inspired by Call of Duty, Doom Eternal, and Half-Life, though with an emphasis on lore-friendly, full-game cohesion.
- DMT (Dead Money Tweaks) - A complete overhaul of the Dead Money DLC, including rebalancing, new gear, weapons, and enemies. Intended to be a pseudo-RPG-survival horror experience inspired by Resident Evil, though with focus on a cohesive and lore-friendly Fallout experience.
- EDGE (Early Decisions and Gameplay Enhancement) - A large-scale overhaul of Tale of Two Wastelands. EDGE initially originated as a mod focused on rebalancing the early game, though has since been expanded to replace many aspects of both Wastelands, including many locations, quests, encounters, NPCs, loot, vendors, SPECIAL stats, and karma. EDGE also comprehensively overhauls the Point Lookout DLC, making it a much more appropriate early game experience.

## Interactions
- Brave New World - A near complete professional revoicing of NPCs throughout the Mojave Wasteland, including more than 7,000 lines of dialogue.

- 3DNPCs - Two expansive content mods, each focused on expanding its respective Wasteland. The Fallout 3 iteration adds 15 quests, 8 companions, many background NPCs, and a radio station to the Capital Wasteland. The Fallout: New Vegas iteration adds 5 quests, 3 companions, and many background NPCs to the Mojave Wasteland.
- Vegas Elysium Perk Pack - A perk and trait pack that introduces new thought cabinet and flaw systems, inspired by the Disco Elysium. In these new systems, the player has a conflicting thought that provides a debuff, though after meeting certain criteria (coming across specific items, encounters, or taking a certain action enough times), the player is able to internalize the “answer” to the thought, ultimately providing a buff.

## Sound
- ATMOS Ambience Overhaul - A massive modernization of the ambient soundscapes of both Wastelands.
- A Music Addition Project - Revised - Overhauls and expands the music in both wastelands with lore friendly, classic Fallout tracks.
- Capital Ruins - Adds music inspired by The Last of Us, Silent Hill, and The Long Dark into the Capital Wasteland, with the goal of setting a darker, more horror appropriate tone.

## Animations
- Enhanced Movement - A complete movement overhaul and expansion, featuring bug fixes, diagonal movement, enhanced sprinting, enhanced sneaking, animated prone framework, and new animations.
- Modern Stagger Animations - A complete replacement for stagger animations made through motion capture. Greatly enhances the flow of combat.
- Simple Attack Reactions - Adds animations to NPCs in response to injury, further enhancing the flow and believability of combat.
- Ragdolls & Death Throes - Dramatically improves ragdoll behavior to create more realistic pain and death animations.

# Visuals
- Desert Natural Weathers - A complete overhaul of the weather of both Wastelands with 360 panoramic cloud textures, improved lighting, and enhanced variation in rain, overcast, clear, snowy, and foggy weather.
- Uranium Haze - Utilizes New Vegas Reloaded (NVR), a custom graphics extender that injects various new shaders and effects into the game, to create a full-game aesthetic overhaul. Includes unique world-space specific presets and various different interior presets with dynamic day-night cycle based lighting.

## Creating a Clean Stock New Vegas Folder
> [!tip]
> This process allows for the creation of a completely **SELF-CONTAINED** installation that does not interfere with any other modded installation of Fallout: New Vegas.
>
> **SKIP** steps 1 and 3 if you have never played or modded this installation of Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas before.

> [!important]
> These instructions will reference the `game library folder`, which refers to the folder in which Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3 are installed.
>
> Default locations for the `game library folder` include `C:\steam\steamapps\common`, `C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\Games`, and `C:\Program Files\Epic Games`.

- Step 1: Creating Clean Installs and Backups of Current Installs/Modded Instances
	- `Navigate` to the `game library folder` and **`MOVE`** the `Fallout New Vegas` folder to the desktop. `Delete` the `Fallout 3` folder.
		- This will be the Steam/GOG/Epic Games installation backup for the pre-existing modded instance. **IF** a seperate modded instance is not installed, simply `delete` the `Fallout New Vegas` folder.
	- Navigate to `C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\My Games` and **`MOVE`** the `FalloutNV` folder to the desktop. `Delete` the `Fallout 3` folder.
		- This will be the settings and saves backup for the pre-existing modded instance. **IF** a seperate modded instance is not installed, simply `delete` the `FalloutNV` folder.
	- `Uninstall` both `Fallout: New Vegas` and `Fallout 3` in Steam/GOG/Epic Games (this step may already be completed automatically).
	- `Reinstall` both `Fallout: New Vegas` and `Fallout 3` in Steam/GOG/Epic Games.

- Step 2: Creating the Clean Stock New Vegas Folder
	- `Navigate` to the **CLEAN** `Fallout New Vegas` folder, which is located inside of the `game library folder`.
	- `Copy` **ALL** of the contents from inside of the `Fallout New Vegas` folder.
		- Click anywhere inside the `game library folder`, press `Ctrl+A` to highlight all files, then `Ctrl+C` to copy all files.
		- Click anywhere inside the `C:\Modding\Uranium Fever\[NoDelete] Stock New Vegas` folder and press `Ctrl+V` to paste the previously copied files.

- Step 3: Restoring Backups of Current Installs/Modded Instances
	- After successfully creating the `Clean Stock New Vegas folder`, `restore` the files that were previously backed up.
		- `Move` your `Fallout New Vegas` folder from your desktop back into `platform installation folder`, selecting `Replace` when prompted.
		- `Move` your `FalloutNV` folder from your desktop back into `C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\My Games`, selecting `Replace` when prompted.

- Step 4: Verifying Files in the Clean Stock New Vegas Folder
	- The clean [NoDelete] Stock New Vegas folder should now contain the following files (with or without the GECK files). If any **ADDITIONAL** files **NOT INCLUDED** in the follow screenshots are present within this folder, **DELETE** the [NoDelete] Stock New Vegas folder, re-run the `Installing Uranium Fever` step, then `start this section over`.
		- Steam - `[NoDelete] Stock New Vegas` file contents:
   
 			![Steam Stock](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c1c1d4c-6bc8-4289-99de-de90610f889d)

 		- GOG - `[NoDelete] Stock New Vegas` file contents:

			![GOG Stock](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00453cc8-f8c7-402b-9ae8-8f2542a640a6)

  		- Epic Games - `[NoDelete] Stock New Vegas` file contents: **I NEED AN EPIC GAME USER TO SEND ME A SIMILAR SCREENSHOT IN THE SAME FORMAT. PLEASE CHANGE THE VIEW TO LIST BEFORE SCREENSHOTTING!**

> [!caution]
> Extra files inside of the Stock New Vegas folder will result in an error when launching the game. These extra files are most often a byproduct of prior modded instances or playthroughs of Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas. As such, the above steps are **CRITICAL**.

> [!warning]
> The TTW Installer **MUST** be run on the copy of Fallout: New Vegas inside of the [NoDelete] Stock New Vegas folder. A prior TTW installation **CANNOT** be moved into the Uranium Fever TTW mod folder. This is because the TTW installation process performs BSA decompression, binary patching, and alteration of sound file extensions to base game files, which is a **REQUIREMENT** for a functional copy of TTW.
  
## Installing New Vegas Reloaded (NVR)
> [!caution]
> This mod is a Uranium Fever installation **REQUIREMENT**, though NVR is disabled in the Performance Profile.

## Installing on Linux
<details><summary>
Expand
</summary>

Linux inherently requires above average operating system knowledge and troubleshooting capability. As such, these instructions are less specific. Support **WILL NOT** be provided for the Linux installation process.

- Requirements:
	- Windows - Access to windows via a seperate installation or a virtual machine.
 	- Lutris, Libstrangle, Steam, and SteamTinkerLaunch.

- Instructions: 
	- Follow the Uranium Fever Installation Instructions **ON WINDOWS** up until the `Disable Base Address Randomization` section.
	- `Copy` the `C:\Modding\Uranium Fever` folder to a temporary location on Linux.
	- `Open Lutris`, click the plus arrow, then search for and install `Fallout: New Vegas`.
		- Take note of the installation location.
		- `Test Fallout: New Vegas` to ensure it functions prior to proceeding.
	- `Install MO2` via `SteakTinkerLaunch`.
	- `Locate the SteamTinkerLaunch installation of MO2` and `copy its wine prefix folder over to Lutris'` **WITHOUT** overwriting any files.
	- In Lutris, right click Fallout: New Vegas, `duplicate its folder`, and `name it Uranium Fever`.
	- `Open the Uranium Fever installation winetricks`, click on `install a dll/component`, and `add lavfilters`. Then, `enable fontsmooth-rgb` in winetricks' settings.
	- `Move your Uranium Fever folder into the Fallout: New Vegas wine prefix folder`, preferably next to the Fallout: New Vegas folder.
	- Right click the Uranium Fever profile and:
		- In the `Runner Options tab` and `change the runner to wine-ge`.
 		- In the `Game Options tab` and `change the executable path` to the `modorganizer.exe` in the `Uranium Fever folder`.
  		- In the `System Options tab`, navigate to `environment tables` and `delete all entries`, instead adding `DXVK_STATE_CACHE disable`. **IF** using an AMD GPU with RADV drivers, also add `RADV_DEBUG noatocdithering`.
	- In command prefix, type `strangle 60`.
	- `Launch Uranium Fever` through Lutris to open MO2.
	- In MO2:
		- In the MO2 settings, navigate to `Paths`, then `Managed Games`. Ensure this path reflects the `Stock New Vegas folder`.
 		- Change the `Executable Path` for `Uranium Fever Launcher` and `Uranium Fever` to reflect the corresponding `executables in the Stock New Vegas folder`.
  		- Open `falloutcustom.ini` and `add iPresentInterval=0 under [Display]`.
	- Repeat the `Configuring Game Settings` section of the Windows installation instructions.
	- The game should now launch appropriately. Prior to starting a new game, open settings, then `Tweaks`, and `disable No Pip-Boy on Alt Tab`.

Caveats:
- MO2's Nexus Handler does not work. As Uranium Fever is updated, corresponding updates will need to be installed manually.
- Double clicking on a mod in MO2 causes MO2 to freeze. Because of this, mods must be edited manually from explorer.
- If problems are encountered, launch Lutris with debug output via the terminal by typing in lutris -d.
 </details>

## Disabling Base Address Randomization 
> [!Tip]
> This step can prevent unforeseen crashes.

- Open `Windows Security` from the `Start Menu`.
- Open `App & Browser Control` in the left sidebar.

## AMD Graphics Card Users - Installing RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS)
> [!tip]
> FPS limiters make the game feel smoother by preventing rapid FPS fluctuations and also prevent timescale desync bugs.
> 
> RTSS is the required FPS limiter for AMD users. Special K is incompatible with modern AMD GPU drivers.

# ![Banner Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2643d768-a2c6-4c15-9457-658d9df8deb0)

- Altering Uranium Fever - Can I alter mods in Uranium Fever?
	- Altered lists will not be supported.
- Black Screen - I have a black screen on game launch. How do I fix it?
	- This is likely due to the combination of Special K and GeForce overlay. Follow the instructions to disable the overlay included in the Special K section above.
	- We do not support alterations of the list.
- Clean Install - Do I need a clean install of Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3 in order to install Uranium Fever?
	- No! Uranium Fever is entirely self contained and seperate from your normal Fallout installations!
- Crashing - I am crashing, what can I do to fix it?
	- Post your crashlog (found in the Uranium Fever > [NoDelete] Stock New Vegas > Crash Logs folder) in the Uranium Fever Support channel on discord (link provided above).
- Dialogue Skill Indicator - Why can't I see the dialogue skill check like I can in the original version of the game?
	- This is an intentional choice to prevent the player from knowing if they will pass a skill check or not.
- Disabled Mods - Should all of the mods that say (IP) after them be disabled?
	- Yes. IP is Uranium Fever's shorthand for Internally Patched, meaning the patch has been merged into the Uranium Fever Master Patch. Because they were used as a resource, these mods remain included so that the authors received the recognition they deserve.
- Failed and Slow Nexus Downloads - Why are all of my downloads so slow, and eventually failing?
	- You failed to connect your nexus account to your wabbajack. Open the settings cogwheel in Wabbajack and connect to your Nexus account.
- First Time Playing - Is the list appropriate for a person who has never played Fallout before?
	- Yes. This list is appropriate for anyone who wants a robust, hardcore gaming experience.
- Keybinds - How do I find Uranium Fever's Keybinds?
	- Press K in the pause menu.
- Launcher - My launcher only gives me an "Install" option and the "Options" is greyed out. Why?
	- Re-run the game launcher from Steam/GOG/Epic Games in order to regenerate the appropriate INIs. This often happens after updating Uranium Fever.
- Manual Installs - Why do I have to manually install TTW and NVR?
	- TTW must be manually installed because modpub does not allow Wabbajack to interface with their website. NVR must be manually downloaded because the download is locked behind discord, which Wabbajack cannot interface with.
- Manual Download Clicks - Why do I have to click to install Vanilla UI + and Vanilla UI Extension?
	- The auto download feature on the moddb website is extremely unreliable, requiring this step to be manual.
- NoDelete - Why do some mods and folders say [NoDelete]?
	- This is a tag that tells Wabbajack not to alter the contents of the tagged folder when updating.
- Notification Size - Why are my notifications huge?
	- Notification size is inappropriately large after starting a new game until the game is reloaded.
- Optimization - What kind of things have you done to optimize Uranium Fever?
	- Many! When appropriate, we use Cathedral Asset Optimizer and Nvidia Texture Tools to compress uncompressed textures and downsize textures to 2k, with a goal of striking the best balance of quality and performance. We generate mipmaps for non-UI textures in order to assist with aesthetics and rendering. We use BSArchPro to place assets into BSAs, which decreases memory usage and crashing. We have optimized LOD rendering distances and priority flagging to ensure only visually relevant items are loaded in at a given time. We have flagged ESPs as ESMs when they contain temporary worldspace edits in order to prevent them from continually being loaded into ram, further decreasing memory usage.
- Other Modded Instances - Can I keep my own modded setup if I play Uranium Fever?
	- Yes. Uranium Fever is entirely self contained through the use of a Stock New Vegas folder. Uranium Fever will not interfere with your other modded setup.
- Pagefile - I have always been told to increase pagefile size for Skyrim, why is that not included in the Uranium Fever installation instructions?
	- Skyrim Special Edition has a much higher memory ceiling than New Vegas, as New Vegas is much older. New Vegas has an upper limit of memory usage of 2.2-2.5gb, and exceeding that causes crashes. This means that the pagefile would not be utilized for the benefit of the game prior to having a memory crash, so there is no benefit in altering this setting.
- Pink Screen - Why do I see pink transition screens when the game loads?
	- You inadverently skipped the 4GB Patching process (running `FNVPatch.exe` in the `C:\Modding\Uranium Fever\[NoDelete] Stock New Vegas` folder).
- Ragdolls - Doesn't Ragdolls cause crashes?
	- No. The original version of ragdolls did cause crashes. The replacement plugin available in Death Throes is **NOT** prone to crashes.
- Resolution - Why is my resolution stuck at 4k?
	- Special K users also need to change it in the Special K menu, then restart the game.
- Runtime Error - Why am i getting a runtime error when I try to launch Uranium Fever?
	- It is likely that you launched MO2 prior to creating your Stock New Vegas folder. Run the Uranium Fever installer again, and it will autocorrect this. You do not have to repeat any Stock New Vegas steps.
- Selecting Perks - I cannot select a perk. Why?
	- By design, you can only select perks at even levels (2, 4, 6, etc..). Due to the functionality of Vegas Elysium, the perk menu **MUST** be shown every level, despite perks not always being available every level.
- Size - Why is the installation requirement so large?
	- Uranium Fever is a robust list with a lot of texture enhancements. Despite our best attempts to consolidate and optimize (we compressed and BSA packed most textures), this ends up taking up a lot of space. The original downloads alone require 50gb of space. Please see the Optional Clean Up section if hard drive space is a limitation for you.
- Skill Tagging - Why doesn't skill tagging work?
	- It does! Uranium Fever uses the classic skill tagging method, where instead of getting a flat boost in skill points, each skill points you input into a tagged skill increases it by two.
- Start Location - Can I start in the Mojave Wasteland?
	- Yes. To start in the Mojave Wasteland, select "memory" when prompted "Is this now, or just a memory?" immediately after leaving the vault.
- Stealing - I cant steal because oft the Purchase on Display mod. How do I fix this?
	- Crouch and you can still steal these items!
- Stock New Vegas - What is the Stock New Vegas Folder and why do I need it?
	- It is an installation of Fallout New Vegas that has already had several root mods installed. It also has the benefit of not altering the Steam/GOG/Epic Games Fallout New Vegas installation. Uranium Fever is entirely self contained in this respect.
- TTW Installation - Can I just move my TTW installation from a prior modlist into the TTW mod folder?
	- No. The TTW Installer edits Fallout New Vegas files in the [NoDelete] Stock New Vegas folder. This is intentional to allow Uranium Fever to be entirely self contained.
- TTW Installation Failed - I am getting an error saying "The installed Fallout: New Vegas version is unsupported". Why?
	- This is because you have not appropriately built your Stock New Vegas folder.
- Vortex - Can I install Uranium Fever with vortex?
	- No. Wabbajack is inherently incompatible with vortex.
