- AGE (Anchorage Gameplay Expansion) - A complete overhaul of the Anchorage DLC including rebalancing, new gear, new weapons, new enemies, new encounters, and new boss fights.

- EDGE (Early Decisions and Gameplay Enhancement) - A large-scale overhaul of Tale of Two Wastelands. EDGE initially originated as a mod focused on rebalancing the early game, though has since been expanded to comprehensively rebalance nearly all aspects of both Wastelands, affecting many weapons, armors, locations, quests, encounters, creatures, companions, NPCs, loot, crafting, vendors, SPECIAL stats, perks, and karma.

## Dialogue Overhaul:

- Vegas Elysium Perk Pack - A perk and trait pack that introduces a new cabinet and flaw systems, inspired by the game Disco Elysium. These new systems typically take the form of the player having a conflicting thought that initially provides a debuff, though after meeting certain criteria (coming across specific items, encounters, or taking a certain action enough times), the player is able to internalize the “answer” to the thought, ultimately providing a substantial buff. The text prompts in this mod are typically very colorful, adding a great deal of depth and fun to the game.

## Sound:
- ATMOS Ambience Overhaul - A massive modernization of the ambient soundscapes of both Wastelands.
- Passive Combat Music Tweaked - Delays combat music until certain conditions have been met, preventing the player from being prematurely notified that they were spotted by enemies.

- Ragdolls & Death Throes - Dramatically improves ragdoll behavior to create more realistic pain and death animations.
- New Vegas Reloaded & Salamand3r's Helios Preset - A custom graphical extender that injects various new effects into the game. Helios utilizes this framework to make uniquely customized and independent world space visuals. This is, arguably, the most beautiful expression of the DC and Mojave Wastelands.
- Desert Natural Weathers - A complete overhaul of the weathers of both Wastelands with 360 panoramic cloud textures, improved lighting, and enhanced variation in rain, overcast, clear, snowy, and foggy weathers.

- In your Uranium Fever Installation Location, navigate to the mods folder, then open [NoDelete] Tale of Two Wastelands. Right click on the filepath at the top and select Copy Address (C:\Modding\Uranium Fever\mods\[NoDelete] Tale of Two Wastelands if you used the recommended file paths).

- Open Windows Security.
- Open Virus & Threat Protection.
- Click Manage Settings under Virus & Threat Protection Settings.
- Scroll down and select Add or Remove Exclusions under Exclusions.
- Select your Uranium Fever Installation Location.
- Add another exclusion for your Wabbajack Installation location.
- This process will also need to be done for any third-party antivirus.
  
## <p align=center>DXVK:</p>
> [!tip]
> DXVK can yield a significant performance boost, though can also cause visual artifacting and increased memory use.  If crashing frequently, REMOVE d3d9.dll and dxvk.conf from your root folder. AMD users who REMOVE DXVK will need to downgrade their graphics card drivers to version 23.12.1. You can accomplish this by using the [AMD Cleanup Utility](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/gpu-601) and google searching `previous YOUR CARD MODEL drivers`.

- MOST users will not have to follow these instructions. The most updated version of DXVK has been provided alongside your Uranium Fever Installation. Those with specific older graphics cards should follow these instructions if unable to launch the game:
	- Intel iGPU users: 
		- Navigate to your Uranium Fever Installation Location > DXVK.
		- Move the DXVK 1.10.1 folder into your game's Root folder, which can be found in your Uranium Fever Installation Location > Stock Game > Fallout New Vegas (C:\Modding\Uranium Fever\Stock Game\Fallout New Vegas if you used the recommended filepaths).
	- Vulkan-less GPU users:
		- If you are not sure that this applies to you, ignore this section.
		- Move the contents inside of the DXVK 1.10.3 folder into your game's Root folder.

## <p align=center>RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS):</p>
> [!tip]
> RTSS is an FPS limiter that can make the game feel much smoother. The theory behind this is that running at a stable and unchanging 60 FPS is less jarring to the user than fluctuanting between 60 to 100 FPS rapidly.

- Install and launch [RTSS](https://www.guru3d.com/download/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download).
- Open your System Tray (the triangle pointing upwards on the taskbar) and click the RTSS icon (an image of a computer screen) to open it.
- Press the green Add button and select FalloutNV.exe.
- Set Application Detection Level to Low.
- Set Framerate Limit to 59.95.
	- Uranium Fever is a graphically intense Wabbajack list. Some users may be able to set higher Framerate Limits, though ensure this is > 0.05 LOWER than your monitors refresh rate.
- Enter settings using the Setup button.
- Enable Passive Waiting.
- Set framerate limiter to Front Edge Sync.

## <p align=center>BSA Decompressor:</p>
> [!tip]
> Decompressing base game BSAs reduces load time and stuttering.

- In your Uranium Fever Installation Location, open the FNV BSA Decompressor folder and run FNV BSA Decompressor.exe.
- The Fallout: New Vegas path needs to be changed to Uranium Fever Installation Location > Stock Game > Fallout New Vegas (C:\Modding\Uranium Fever\Stock Game\Fallout New Vegas if you used the recommended filepaths).
- Decompressed Archives path needs to be changed to Uranium Fever Installation Location > Stock Game > Fallout New Vegas > Data (C:\Modding\Uranium Fever\Stock Game\Fallout New Vegas\Data if you used the recommended filepaths).
- Click Decompress, then exit the program once finished.

# <p align=center>Launching The Game:</p>
- The game CANNOT be launched outside of MO2. Launching from Steam or GOG **WILL** fail.
- In MO2, select Uranium Fever from the dropdown list in the top right, then click run.
 
# <p align=center>Cleaning Up:</p>
> [!tip]
> This is an OPTIONAL step to remove unneeded files from your computer. This will make the updating or reinstalling process take longer, as these files will need to be re-downloaded.

- Confirm that your game launches and runs appropriately before following these steps.
- Navigate to the Uranium Fever Installation Location > downloads folder (C:\Modding\Uranium Fever\downloads if you used the recommended filepaths).
- Delete the downloads folder.

# <p align=center>Updating Uranium Fever</p>
- Reinstall the list from the Wabbajack tool and enable the "Overwrite Installation" checkbox.
- Reapply the BSA Decompressor as instructed above.

# <p align=center>FAQ:</p>
- Crashing - I am crashing, what can I do to fix it?
	- Post your crashlog (found in the Uranium Fever > Stock Game > Crash Logs folder) in the Uranium Fever Support channel on discord (link provided above).
- Keybinds - How do I find Uranium Fever's Keybinds?
	- Press K in the pause menu.
- Manual Installs - Why do I have to manually install TTW, NVR, and Stash Organizer?
	- Modpub does not allow automated wabbajack downloading. We apologize for this inconvenience.
