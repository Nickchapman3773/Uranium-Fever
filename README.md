## Balance
- Sweets Simple Settings - Adjusts various gameplay settings to promote a more difficult, hardcore experience. Modifications include damage, health, AP, carry weight, crippled limb penalties, dismemberment, skill tags, and vendor respawn timing.
- Harder Barter Faster Stronger (Sicko Mode) - Rebalances the economy around the barter skill, functionally creating a much more punishing economy.
- Bullet Time - Utilized in Uranium Fever to completely supplant VATS, Bullet Time is a robust, AP-based, time-scaling function with an emphasis on careful player aim and thoughtful decision making.
- Armor Damage Overhaul - Replaces the nonsensical base game armor degradation system with a design that is highly customizable and markedly more intuitive.
- New Blood - A complete reconstruction and rebalancing of damage in its entirety. New Blood adds bleeding effects when struck by bladed weapons and formula based knockdown when hit by blunt weapons or shotgun shots.
- Famine - A loot scarcity mod that punishes poor resource management habits and forces the player to engage with the barter and crafting systems.
- RAD Radiation Is Actually Dangerous - A hardcore overhaul to radiation, dehydration, hunger, and sleep deprivation, making these effects considerably more impactful 
- Sweet Consumables - A top-to-bottom reconstruction of consumables and miscellaneous items with a focus on deliberate and thoughtful balance.

- Sweet Healing Systems - A comprehensive overhaul and rebalancing of doctors, sleep, endurance, infirmary based healing and radiation removal, doctor radiation removal, radiation dispersal over time, infirmary detox, and addiction removal.
- SPARE Sweet Part and Ammo Rebalance and Expansion - A complete rebalancing of the ammo crafting system, with cohesive breakdown recipes, battery-based energy cell recharging, explosives crafting and breakdown, added ammo types, a consistent naming scheme, a transition to vendor sold boxes of ammo, and economy improvements.
- SWEEP Sweet Weapon Enhancement and Expansion Package - A complete rebalance of weapons intended to create a cohesive and balanced system with more gradual weapon progression.
- Sweet Dynamic Detection System - Enhances NPCs ability to detect the player at longer distances, functionally nerfing sniping.
- Simple AI Merge - A long-term collection of AI improvements made by one of the game’s leading engine experts. This mod makes combat far more engaging.
- Immersive Recoil 2.0 - Adds realistic recoil to guns, making combat far more challenging.
- Immersive Recoil NPC - Adds a recoil-like mechanic to NPCs, greatly improving the flow of combat.
- Weapon Jamming Tweaks - Adjusts weapon jamming to foster a more hardcore experience. Fixes several jam related bugs, and adds a new jam clearing function.

## Functions
- Bad Touch - Adds consequences to exposure to environmental hazards, such as fire, electricity, cacti, broken glass, toxic sludge pools, poisonous gas, and radioactive goo.
- BURN (Hardcore Fire Effects) - Causes unprotected humans and flammable creatures to panic and flee when set on fire, enhancing gameplay mechanics for fire and explosive based weaponry.
- Forced Entry - Allows the player to bypass locks by attacking them. This forces the player to choose between using different scarce resources (lockpicks, ammo, or melee weapon condition) to open locks.
- Universal Water Bottling - Allows the player to fill empty bottles or canteens from any water source. This facilitates harsher H2O consumption settings and consequences, while also adding resource availability to ameliorate said hardcore needs.
- Immersive Minigames - Real-time, character-skill based replacements for hacking and lockpicking, with an emphasis on resource management. Allows for skipping the redundant lockpicking and hacking minigames in favor of holding a hotkey with pre-determined odds of success. This mod generally decreases minigame success rates, making associated resources more impactful.
- B42 Quickthrow - Adds a new, modernized weapon throwing mechanic, further promoting the use of throwables.
- Purchase Items on Display - Allows purchase of items directly off of shelves in shops, rather than bartering directly with vendors. Most mods included in Uranium Fever have items specifically placed and balanced for use with this mod.

## Comprehensive Overhauls
- Functional Post Game Ending - Adds a fully functional, post-game world, fully fleshed out with the consequences of your actions. You will no longer be brought to the credits after beating the game.

- Sweet Pain - Adds many intense and unique locations throughout the game, all packed with lore and excitement.
- Mojave Raiders - A complete overhaul and diversification of the many Raider factions of the Mojave Wasteland.
- AGE (Anchorage Gameplay Expansion) - A complete overhaul of the Anchorage DLC, including rebalancing, new gear, weapons, enemies, encounters,and boss fights. Heavily inspired by Call of Duty, Doom Eternal, and Half-Life, though with an emphasis on lore-friendly, full-game cohesion.
- DMT (Dead Money Tweaks) - A complete overhaul of the Dead Money DLC including rebalancing and new gear, weapons, and enemies. Intended to be a pseudo-RPG-survival horror experience inspired by Resident Evil, though with focus on a cohesive and lore-friendly Fallout experience.
- EDGE (Early Decisions and Gameplay Enhancement) - A large-scale overhaul of Tale of Two Wastelands. EDGE initially originated as a mod focused on rebalancing the early game, though has since been expanded to replace many aspects of both Wastelands, affecting many locations, quests, encounters, NPCs, loot, vendors, SPECIAL stats, and karma. Also includes an overhaul of Point Lookout to make it more appropriate for lower leveled gameplay.

## Dialogue Overhauls
- Brave New World - A near complete professional revoicing of NPCs throughout the Mojave Wasteland, including more than 7,000 lines of dialogue.

- 3DNPCs - Two expansive content mods, each focused on expanding its respective Wasteland. The Fallout 3 iteration adds 15 quests, 8 companions, many background NPCs, and a radio station to the Capital Wasteland. The Fallout: New Vegas iteration adds 5 quests, 3 companions, and many background NPCs to the Mojave Wasteland.
- Vegas Elysium Perk Pack - A perk and trait pack that introduces new thought cabinet and flaw systems, inspired by the Disco Elysium. In these new systems, the player has a conflicting thought that provides a debuff, though after meeting certain criteria (coming across specific items, encounters, or taking a certain action enough times), the player is able to internalize the “answer” to the thought, ultimately providing a buff.

## Sound
- ATMOS Ambience Overhaul - A massive modernization of the ambient soundscapes of both Wastelands.
- Passive Combat Music Tweaked - Delays combat music until certain conditions have been met, preventing the player from being prematurely notified that they were spotted by enemies.

## Animation & Visual

- Ragdolls & Death Throes - Dramatically improves ragdoll behavior to create more realistic pain and death animations.
- New Vegas Reloaded & Salamand3r's Helios Preset - A custom graphical extender that injects various new effects into the game. Helios utilizes this framework to make uniquely customized and independent world space visuals. This is, arguably, the most beautiful aesthetic expression available for Fallout.
- Desert Natural Weathers - A complete overhaul of the weathers of both Wastelands with 360 panoramic cloud textures, improved lighting, and enhanced variation in rain, overcast, clear, snowy, and foggy weathers.

## Installing Tale of Two Wastelands (TTW)
> [!important]
> This mod is **REQUIRED** for Uranium Fever to function properly.
>
> You **MUST** use the TTW Installer. A prior TTW installation **CANNOT** be moved into the Uranium Fever TTW mod folder. This is because the TTW installation process performs BSA decompression, binary patching, and alteration of sound file extensions to base game files, which needs to be run on the copy of Fallout: New Vegas inside of the [NoDelete] Stock New Vegas folder.

- Download the <a href="https://mod.pub/ttw/133/files" onclick="window.open('https://mod.pub/ttw/133/files', '_self');">3.3.2a Tale of Two Wastelands Installer</a> and `extract the contents of the archive`.

## Installing New Vegas Reloaded (NVR)
> [!important]
> This mod is **REQURIED** for the standard Uranium Fever profile, though disabled in the Performance Profile.

- Navigate to the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/r8EFG5YGBj" onclick="window.open('https://discord.com/invite/r8EFG5YGBj', '_self');">TES Reloaded Discord Server</a>.

> [!tip]
> This process prevents windows from blocking MO2 and associated mod files from loading.
 
- Open `Windows Security`.
- Open `Virus & Threat Protection`.
- Click `Manage Settings` under `Virus & Threat Protection Settings`.
- Scroll down and select `Add or Remove Exclusions` under `Exclusions`.
- `Add exclusions` for `C:\Modding\Uranium Fever` and `C:\Modding\Wabbajack`.
- This process will also need to be replicated for any third-party antivirus.
  
## Disabling Steam Overlay
> [!tip]
> This process disables Steam Overlay, which has been known to cause crashes and worsen performance. 
 
- Navigate to your `Steam Folder` (the same folder where your steam.exe is).
- Right click `GameOverlayRenderer.dll` and open `properties`.
- Open the `security tab` and click `edit`.

- Click `Apply`, then `Yes`.
  
## About DXVK
> [!tip]
> DXVK can yield a significant performance boost, though can also cause visual artifacting and increased memory usage. If crashing frequently, REMOVE `d3d9.dll` and `dxvk.conf` from the Uranium Fever > `[NoDelete] Stock New Vegas`. To avoid crashes, AMD users who REMOVE DXVK will **NEED** to `downgrade graphics card drivers` to <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-23-40-33-03.html" onclick="window.open('https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-23-40-33-03.html', '_self');">Version 23.40.33.03</a>. This can be accomplished by first running the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/gpu-601" onclick="window.open('https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/gpu-601', '_self');">AMD Cleanup Utility</a>.

> [!warning]
> ONLY perform the following steps if your game crashes before fully booting up.

- MOST users will not have to follow these instructions. The most updated version of DXVK has already been **pre-installed** in Uranium Fever. Those with older graphics cards (Intel iGPU or no Vulkan functionality) should follow these instructions if unable to launch the game:
	- Intel iGPU users:
		- Navigate to the `Uranium Fever > DXVK folder`.
		- Move the `d3d9.dll` and `dxvk.conf` from the `DXVK 1.10.1` folder into the game's Root folder at `C:\Modding\Uranium Fever\[NoDelete] Stock New Vegas`.
	- Vulkan-less GPU users:
		- Navigate to the `Uranium Fever > DXVK folder`.
		- Move the `d3d9.dll` and `dxvk.conf` from the `1.10.3` folder into the game's Root folder at `C:\Modding\Uranium Fever\[NoDelete] Stock New Vegas`.

## Disabling DXVK Cache Storage
> [!tip]
> DXVK Cache Storage is known to cause memory related crashes. This process prevents DXVK from creating a cache.

- Press the `windows button`.
- Type `Env` in the search bar, and click `Edit the system environmental variables` that pops up.
- Click `Environmental Variables`.
- Click `New` under `User variables for USER NAME`.
- Type `DXVK_STATE_CACHE` into the `Variable name`.
- Type `disable` into the `Variable value`.
- Click `OK`.
- Exit `Environmental Variables`.
- Restart your computer for this to take effect.

## AMD Graphics Card Users - RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS)
> [!tip]
> FPS limiters can make the game feel much smoother. The theory behind this is that running at a stable and unchanging 60 FPS is less jarring to the user than rapidly fluctuating between 50 to 100 FPS. This also prevents the timescale desync that can occur if the FPS surpasses your monitors refresh rate.
> 
> RTSS is the recommended option for AMD graphics card users. Special K lacks compatibility with the combination of AMD graphics cards and DXVK.
> NVIDIA graphics card users **WILL** have memory related crashes if following this section instead of the following Special K section.

- Install and launch <a href="https://www.guru3d.com/download/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download" onclick="window.open('https://www.guru3d.com/download/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download', '_self');">RTSS</a>.
- Open the `System Tray` (the triangle pointing upwards on the taskbar) and click the `RTSS icon` (an image of a computer screen) to open it.
- Press the green `Add` button and select `FalloutNV.exe` from your `Steam/GOG/Epic Games directory` **OR** from `C:\Modding\Uranium Fever\[NoDelete] Stock New Vegas` (as long as RTSS detects ANY instance of `FalloutNV.exe` it will function).
- Set `Application Detection Level` to `Low`.
- Set `Framerate Limit` to `59.95`.
	- Uranium Fever is a graphically intense Wabbajack list. Some users may be able to set higher Framerate Limits, though ensure that the Framerate Limit is > 0.05 LOWER than your monitors refresh rate.
- Enter settings using the `Setup` button.
- Scroll down and enable `Passive Waiting`.
- Set `Framerate Limiter` to `Front Edge Sync`.
- Optionally enable `On-Screen Display Support` and use the `X,Y Coordinate Buttons` at the bottom to adjust On-Screen FPS display location.
- Minimize RTSS back to the System Tray.

## NVIDIA Graphics Card Users - Special K
> [!tip]
> FPS limiters can make the game feel much smoother. The theory behind this is that running at a stable and unchanging 60 FPS is less jarring to the user than rapidly fluctuating between 50 to 100 FPS. This also prevents the timescale desync that can occur if the FPS surpasses your monitors refresh rate.
>
> Special K is the recommended option for NVIDIA graphics card users. RTSS is not able to configure flip and interop appropriately, which causes a large amount of memory related crashes.
> AMD graphics card users **WILL NOT** be able to launch the game if following this section instead of the following RTSS section.

- `Navigate` to GeForce Experience settings and `turn off NVIDIA overlay` (found in settings > General > In-Game Overlay), as the overlay will cause a black screen if used alongside Special K.
- `Download` <a href="https://sk-data.special-k.info/SpecialK.7z" onclick="window.open('https://sk-data.special-k.info/SpecialK.7z', '_self');">Special K</a>.
- `Extract` the downloaded archive into your downloads folder.
- `Open` the `SpecialK` folder.
- `Rename SpecialK32.dll` to `dinput8.dll`.
- `Move` the newly renamed `dinput8.dll` into the `C:\Modding\Uranium Fever\[NoDelete] Stock New Vegas` folder.
- `Download` the <a href="https://performance.moddinglinked.com/files/sk.zip" onclick="window.open('https://performance.moddinglinked.com/files/sk.zip', '_self');">Viva New Vegas Preconfigured Settings Archive</a>.
- `Extract` the newly downloaded `SK.zip` into the `C:\Modding\Uranium Fever\[NoDelete] Stock New Vegas` folder.
- `Launch` Uranium Fever (launch instructions are included below).
- `Select Yes` when prompted to enable DXVK support/vulkan bridge, then `relaunch` the game.
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Backspace` to enter the `Special K Control Panel`.
- Under the `Framerate Limiter`, click the `Enable Framerate Limit` checkbox.
- `Right click the bar next to Framerate Limit` (the one that specifies fps and says `(Limit Engaged)`, NOT the graph).
- `Select` your monitors refresh rate.
- `Click Advanced` and select `Latent Sync (VSYNC -off-) mode`.
- `Double Left Click` on the bar and type in 59.995, and `press enter`.
- For instructions on configuring Latent Sync or enabling V-Sync or Variable Refresh Rate, please reference the <a href="https://performance.moddinglinked.com/falloutnv.html#RecommendedLimiters" onclick="window.open('https://performance.moddinglinked.com/falloutnv.html#RecommendedLimiters', '_self');">Special K section of Wall's Performance Guide</a>, though this is beyond the scope of Uranium Fever configuration.

## NVIDIA G-Sync Users
> [!tip]
> G-Sync windowed should **NEVER** be enabled globally, but has to be configured for Fallout: New Vegas, as the game is technically run in windowed mode.

- Download <a href="https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector/releases/latest" onclick="window.open('https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector/releases/latest', '_self');">NVIDIA Profile Inspector</a>.
- `Extract nvidiaProfileInspector.zip` and `run nvidiaProfileInspector.exe`.
- `Click` the `Profiles` drop down menu near the top of the page.
- Type `Fallout` into the `search bar` and `select Fallout - New Vegas` from the options.
- Locate `GSYNC Application mode` under the `2. Sync and Refresh` section.
- On the right, open the drop down menu and `select Fullscreen and Windowed`
- `Click Apply Changes` in the top right.

> [!caution]
> G-Sync in Fallout: New Vegas is prone to visual bugs. If you encounter visual bugs, please disable G-Sync rather than request support.

## Launching The Game
- The game **CANNOT** be launched outside of MO2. Launching from Steam or GOG **WILL FAIL** to launch Uranium Fever.
- In MO2, select `Uranium Fever` from the dropdown list in the top right, then click `run`.
- After starting a new game, open the pause menu and press K to see the Keybinds and associated legend. More details are included below in the Mod Feature Quick Reference List section.

> [!note]
> A desktop shortcut can be created by selecting the `Shortcut` option in the top right of MO2 (next to Run) and selecting `Desktop`. However, this will **NEED** to be re-created every time you update Uranium Fever.

## Optional Performance Profile
> [!tip]
> This is an OPTIONAL step for those with weaker computers. Use the Performance Profile to gain better performance in exchange for worse visuals. This profile disables Real Time Reflections, New Vegas Reloaded, and other associated mods.

- In MO2, select `Uranium Fever` from the large dropdown list in the top middle, then click the `Uranium Fever Performance` Profile.
 
## Optional Clean Up
> [!tip]
> This is an OPTIONAL step to remove unneeded files from your computer. This will make the updating or reinstalling process take longer, as these files will need to be re-downloaded.

- Confirm that the game launches and runs appropriately before following this step.
- Navigate to `C:\Modding\Uranium Fever\downloads`.
- `Delete` the `downloads folder`.

# <p align=center>Updating Uranium Fever</p>
- Using Wabbajack, `reinstall Uranium Fever` into the `Uranium Fever folder` with the `Overwrite Installation` checkbox enabled.

# <p align=center>FAQ</p>
<details><summary>

</summary>

- Altering Uranium Fever - Can I alter mods in Uranium Fever?
	- We do not support alterations of the list.
- Clean Install - Do I need a clean install of Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3 in order to install Uranium Fever?
	- No! Uranium Fever is entirely self contained and seperate from your normal Fallout installations!
- Crashing - I am crashing, what can I do to fix it?
	- Post your crashlog (found in the Uranium Fever > [NoDelete] Stock New Vegas > Crash Logs folder) in the Uranium Fever Support channel on discord (link provided above).
- Disabled Mods - Should all of the mods that say (IP) after them be disabled?
	- Yes. IP is Uranium Fever's shorthand for Internally Patched, meaning the patch has been merged into the Uranium Fever Master Patch. Because they were used as a resource, these mods remain included so that the authors received the recognition they deserve.
- Failed and Slow Nexus Downloads - Why are all of my downloads so slow, and eventually failing?
	- You failed to connect your nexus account to your wabbajack. Open the settings cogwheel in Wabbajack and connect to your Nexus account.
- First Time Playing - Is the list appropriate for a person who has never played Fallout before?
	- Yes. This list is appropriate for anyone who wants a robust, hardcore gaming experience.
- Keybinds - How do I find Uranium Fever's Keybinds?
	- Press K in the pause menu.
- Manual Installs - Why do I have to manually install TTW and NVR?
	- TTW must be manually installed because modpub does not allow Wabbajack to interface with their website. NVR must be manually downloaded because the download is locked behind discord, which Wabbajack cannot interface with.
- Manual Download Clicks - Why do I have to click to install Vanilla UI + and Vanilla UI Extension?
	- The auto download feature on the moddb website is extremely unreliable, requiring this step to be manual.
- NoDelete - Why do some mods and folders say [NoDelete]?
	- This is a tag that tells Wabbajack not to alter the contents of the tagged folder when updating.
- Notification Size - Why are my notifications huge?
	- Notification size is inappropriately large after starting a new game until the game is restarted.
- Other Modded Instances - Can I keep my own modded setup if I play Uranium Fever?
	- Yes. Uranium Fever is entirely self contained through the use of a Stock New Vegas folder. Uranium Fever will not interfere with your other modded setup.
- Pink Screen - Why do I see pink transition screens when the game loads?
	- You inadverently skipped the 4GB Patching process (running `FNVPatch.exe` in the `C:\Modding\Uranium Fever\[NoDelete] Stock New Vegas` folder).
- Ragdolls - Doesn't Ragdolls cause crashes?
	- No. The original version of ragdolls did cause crashes. The replacement plugin available in Death Throes is **NOT** prone to crashes.
- Reloading - 
- Runtime Error - Why am i getting a runtime error when I try to launch Uranium Fever?
	- It is likely that you launched MO2 prior to creating your Stock New Vegas folder. Run the Uranium Fever installer again, and it will autocorrect this. You do not have to repeat any Stock New Vegas steps.
- Selecting Perks - I cannot select a perk. Why?
	- By design, you can only select perks at even levels (2, 4, 6, etc..). Due to the functionality of Vegas Elysium, the perk menu **MUST** be shown every level, despite perks not always being available every level.
- Size - Why is the installation requirement so large?
	- Uranium Fever is a robust list with a lot of texture enhancements. Despite our best attempts to consolidate and optimize (we compressed and BSA packed most textures), this ends up taking up a lot of space. The original downloads alone require 50gb of space. Please see the Optional Clean Up section if hard drive space is a limitation for you.
- Skill Tagging - Why doesn't skill tagging work?
	- It does! Uranium Fever uses the classic skill tagging method, where instead of getting a flat boost in skill points, each skill points you input into a tagged skill increases it by two.
- Start Location - Can I start in the Mojave Wasteland?
	- Yes. To start in the Mojave Wasteland, select "memory" when prompted "Is this now, or just a memory?" immediately after leaving the vault.
- Stock New Vegas - What is the Stock New Vegas Folder and why do I need it?
	- It is an installation of Fallout New Vegas that has already had several root mods installed. It also has the benefit of not altering the Steam/GOG/Epic Games Fallout New Vegas installation. Uranium Fever is entirely self contained in this respect.
- TTW Installation - Can I just move my TTW installation from a prior modlist into the TTW mod folder?
	- No. The TTW Installer edits Fallout New Vegas files in the [NoDelete] Stock New Vegas folder. This is intentional to allow Uranium Fever to be entirely self contained.
- Vortex - Can I install Uranium Fever with vortex?
	- No. Wabbajack is inherently incompatible with vortex.
