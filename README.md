- BURN (Hardcore Fire Effects) - Causes unprotected humans and flammable creatures to panic and flee when set on fire, enhancing gameplay mechanics for fire and explosive based weaponry.
- Forced Entry - Allows the player to bypass locks by attacking them. This makes the player choose between using different scarce resources, lockpicks or ammo and weapon condition.

## Comprehensive Overhauls
- Functional Post Game Ending - Adds a fully functional post-game world to the game. You will no longer be brought to the credits after beating the game.

- Uncut Wastelands - Restores a massive amount of scenery, items, and NPCs that were patched out of the game following release.
- The Living Desert - Adds hundreds of NPCs and scripted events to the Mojave Wasteland, further fleshing out the Fallout universe.
- Sweet Pain - Adds many intense and unique locations throughout the game, all packed with lore and excitement.
- Mojave Raiders - A complete overhaul and diversification of the many Raider factions of the Mojave Wasteland.
- AGE (Anchorage Gameplay Expansion) - A complete overhaul of the Anchorage DLC including rebalancing, new gear, new weapons, new enemies, new encounters, and new boss fights. Heavily inspired by Call of Duty, Doom Eternal, and Half-Life, though with an emphasis on full-game cohesion and lore-friendliness.
- DMT (Dead Money Tweaks) - A complete overhaul of the Dead Money DLC including rebalancing, new gear, new weapons, and new enemies. Intended to be a pseudo-RPG-survival horror experience inspired by Resident Evil, though with focus on full-game cohesion and lore-friendliness.
- EDGE (Early Decisions and Gameplay Enhancement) - A large-scale overhaul of Tale of Two Wastelands. EDGE initially originated as a mod focused on rebalancing the early game, though has since been expanded to comprehensively rebalance nearly all aspects of both Wastelands, affecting many weapons, armors, locations, quests, encounters, creatures, companions, NPCs, loot, crafting, vendors, SPECIAL stats, perks, and karma.

## Dialogue Overhauls
- Brave New World - A near complete professional revoicing of voice lines throughout the Mojave Wasteland, including more than 7,000 lines of dialogue.
- Dialogue & Interaction Expansion Overhaul - A comprehensive overhaul of player dialogue and interaction choices.

## NPC & Enemy Overhauls
- Companion Characteristics - Provides gameplay quirks derived from companion personality traits.
- Mojave Wildlife - Adds hundreds of leveled, vanilla-friendly creature spawn points throughout the Mojave Wasteland.

## Content
- Autumn Leaves - A DLC-sized quest mod delving into a centuries-old library inhabited by sentient machines. Contains over 2,000 professionally voiced lines, 8 new quests, around 10 hours of gameplay, multiple different endings, and an original soundtrack.
- Havasu Blues - A DLC-sized quest mod featuring an irradiated survival experience in the territory surrounding Lake Havasu City. Includes more than 60 professionally voiced characters, 28 new quests, around 10 hours of gameplay, and an entirely new world space.
- 3DNPCs - Two expansive content mods, each focused on expanding its respective Wasteland. The first adds 15 quests, 8 companions, many background NPCs, and a radio station to the Capital Wasteland. The second adds 5 quests, 3 companions, and many background NPCs to the Mojave Wasteland.
- Vegas Elysium Perk Pack - A perk and trait pack that introduces a new cabinet and flaw systems, inspired by the game Disco Elysium. These new systems typically take the form of the player having a conflicting thought that initially provides a debuff, though after meeting certain criteria (coming across specific items, encounters, or taking a certain action enough times), the player is able to internalize the “answer” to the thought, ultimately providing a substantial buff. The text prompts in this mod are typically very colorful, adding a great deal of depth and fun to the game.

## Sound
- ATMOS Ambience Overhaul - A massive modernization of the ambient soundscapes of both Wastelands.
- Passive Combat Music Tweaked - Delays combat music until certain conditions have been met, preventing the player from being prematurely notified that they were spotted by enemies.

## Animation & Visual
- 3rd Person Camera Overhaul - Adds modernized camera features, such as shoulder swapping, smooth interactive camera movement, and fully fleshed out customizable camera positioning.
- Armed to the Teeth Redux - Allows the player to holster 4 weapons on their body at once.
- Titans of the New West 2.0 - A complete reimagining and retexturing of power armor to achieve a much more heavy and imposing aesthetic. Also including many new features, animations, and sound effects.

- Enhanced Movement - A complete movement overhaul and expansion, featuring bug fixes, diagonal movement, enhanced sprinting, enhanced sneaking, animated prone framework, and new animations.
- Modern Stagger Animations - A complete replacement for stagger animations made via motion capture. Greatly enhances the flow of combat.
- Simple Attack Reactions - Adds animations to NPCs in response to being injured. Greatly enhances the flow of combat.
- Ragdolls & Death Throes - Dramatically improves ragdoll behavior to create more realistic pain and death animations.
- New Vegas Reloaded & Salamand3r's Helios Preset - A custom graphical extender that injects various new effects into the game. Helios utilizes this framework to make uniquely customized and independent world space visuals. This is, arguably, the most beautiful expression of the DC and Mojave Wastelands.
- Desert Natural Weathers - A complete overhaul of the weathers of both Wastelands with 360 panoramic cloud textures, improved lighting, and enhanced variation in rain, overcast, clear, snowy, and foggy weathers.

## Installing Tale of Two Wastelands
> [!important]
> This mod is REQUIRED for Uranium Fever to function properly.
>
> You **CANNOT** just move your TTW installation from a different location, as the installer edits New Vegas Files included in the Stock Games folder of the Wabbajack.

- Download the <a href="https://mod.pub/ttw/133/files" onclick="window.open('https://mod.pub/ttw/133/files', '_self');">3.3.2a Tale of Two Wastelands Installer</a> and extract the contents of the archive anywhere outside of the default Windows folders.

- Click Install.

> [!caution]
> The game **WILL NOT WORK** if you fail to change the Fallout New Vegas installation file path to reflect the New Vegas installation provided in the Stock Game folder. 
  
## Installing New Vegas Reloaded (NVR)
> [!important]
> This mod is REQUIRED for Uranium Fever to function properly.

- Navigate to the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/r8EFG5YGBj" onclick="window.open('https://discord.com/invite/r8EFG5YGBj', '_self');">TES Reloaded Discord Server</a>.
- In the Nightly Builds channel, download the NVR Nightly release from March 29th, 2024. **DO NOT** use the latest build.
- Extract the download into the `[NoDelete] NVR folder`.
	- This can be found in Uranium Fever Installation Location > mods (`C\Modding\Uranium Fever\mods\[NoDelete] NVR` if you used the recommended file paths).
  
## Installing Stash Organizer
> [!important]
> This mod is REQUIRED for Uranium Fever to function properly.

- Download <a href="https://mod.pub/falloutnv/4-stash-organizer" onclick="window.open('https://mod.pub/falloutnv/4-stash-organizer', '_self');">Stash Organizer</a>.
	- Select Manual download.
- Extract the download into the `[NoDelete] Stash Organizer folder`.
	- This can be found in Uranium Fever Installation Location > mod (`C\Modding\Uranium Fever\mods\[NoDelete] Stash Organizer` if you used the recommended file paths).

## Creating Exclusions
> [!tip]
> This process prevents windows from blocking MO2 and associated mod files from loading.
 
- Open Windows Security.
- Open Virus & Threat Protection.
- Click Manage Settings under Virus & Threat Protection Settings.
- Scroll down and select Add or Remove Exclusions under Exclusions.
- Select the Uranium Fever Installation Location.
- Add another exclusion for the Wabbajack Installation location.
- This process will also need to be done for any third-party antivirus.
  
## DXVK
> [!tip]
> DXVK can yield a significant performance boost, though can also cause visual artifacting and increased memory use. If crashing frequently, REMOVE `d3d9.dll` and `dxvk.conf` from the Uranium Fever 
 > Stock Game > New Vegas folder. AMD users who REMOVE DXVK will need to downgrade their graphics card drivers to version 23.12.1. This can be accomplished by using the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/gpu-601" onclick="window.open('https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/gpu-601', '_self');">AMD Cleanup Utility</a> and google searching `previous YOUR CARD MODEL drivers`.

- MOST users will not have to follow these instructions. The most updated version of DXVK has already been pre-installed by default in Uranium Fever. Those with older graphics cards (no vulkan, or Intel iGPU) should follow these instructions if unable to launch the game:
	- Intel iGPU users:
		- Navigate to the Uranium Fever Installation Location > DXVK.
		- Move the DXVK 1.10.1 folder into the game's Root folder, which can be found in the Uranium Fever Installation Location > Stock Game > Fallout New Vegas (`C\Modding\Uranium Fever\Stock Game\Fallout New Vegas` if you used the recommended filepaths).
	- Vulkan-less GPU users:
		- If you are not sure that this applies to you, ignore this section.
		- Move the contents inside of the DXVK 1.10.3 folder into the game's Root folder, which can be found in the Uranium Fever Installation Location > Stock Game > Fallout New Vegas (`C\Modding\Uranium Fever\Stock Game\Fallout New Vegas` if you used the recommended filepaths).

## RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS)
> [!tip]
> RTSS is an FPS limiter that can make the game feel much smoother. The theory behind this is that running at a stable and unchanging 70 FPS is less jarring to the user than fluctuating between 60 to 100 FPS rapidly. This also prevents the timescale desync that can occur if you surpass your monitors refresh rate.

- Install and launch <a href="https://www.guru3d.com/download/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download" onclick="window.open('https://www.guru3d.com/download/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download', '_self');">RTSS</a>.
- Open the System Tray (the triangle pointing upwards on the taskbar) and click the RTSS icon (an image of a computer screen) to open it.
- Press the green Add button and select FalloutNV.exe.
- Set Application Detection Level to Low.
- Set Framerate Limit to 59.95.
	- Uranium Fever is a graphically intense Wabbajack list. Some users may be able to set higher Framerate Limits, though ensure this is > 0.05 LOWER than your monitors refresh rate.
- Enter settings using the Setup button.
- Enable Passive Waiting.
- Set framerate limiter to Front Edge Sync.

## BSA Decompressor
> [!tip]
> Decompressing base game BSAs reduces load time and stuttering.

- In the `Uranium Fever Installation Location`, open the `FNV BSA Decompressor folder` and run `FNV BSA Decompressor.exe`.
- The Fallout New Vegas path needs to be changed to Uranium Fever Installation Location > Stock Game > Fallout New Vegas (`C\Modding\Uranium Fever\Stock Game\Fallout New Vegas` if you used the recommended filepaths).
- Decompressed Archives path needs to be changed to Uranium Fever Installation Location > Stock Game > Fallout New Vegas > Data (`C\Modding\Uranium Fever\Stock Game\Fallout New Vegas\Data` if you used the recommended filepaths).
- Click Decompress, then exit the program once finished.

# Launching The Game
- The game CANNOT be launched outside of MO2. Launching from Steam or GOG **WILL** fail.
- In MO2, select Uranium Fever from the dropdown list in the top right, then click run.
 
# Cleaning Up
> [!tip]
> This is an OPTIONAL step to remove unneeded files from your computer. This will make the updating or reinstalling process take longer, as these files will need to be re-downloaded.

- Confirm that the game launches and runs appropriately before following these steps.
- Navigate to the Uranium Fever Installation Location > downloads folder (`C\Modding\Uranium Fever\downloads` if you used the recommended filepaths).
- Delete the downloads folder.

# <p align=center>Updating Uranium Fever</p>
- Reinstall the list from the Wabbajack tool and enable the "Overwrite Installation" checkbox.
- Reapply the BSA Decompressor as instructed above.

# <p align=center>FAQ</p>
- Crashing - I am crashing, what can I do to fix it?
	- Post your crashlog (found in the Uranium Fever > Stock Game > Crash Logs folder) in the Uranium Fever Support channel on discord (link provided above).
- Failed and Slow Nexus Downloads - Why are all of my downloads so slow, and eventually failing?
	- You failed to connect your nexus account to your wabbajack. Open the settings cogwheel in Wabbajack and log into your Nexus account.
- First Time Playing - Is the list appropriate for a person who has never played Fallout before?
	- Yes. This list is appropriate for anyone who wants a robust, hardcore gaming experience.
- Keybinds - How do I find Uranium Fever's Keybinds?
	- Press K in the pause menu.
- Manual Installs - Why do I have to manually install TTW, NVR, and Stash Organizer?
	- Modpub does not allow automated wabbajack downloading. We apologize for this inconvenience..
- Manual Installs - Why do I have to click to install Vanilla UI + and Vanilla UI Extension?
	- The auto download feature on the moddb website is extremely unreliable, requiring this step to be manual.
- Other Modded Instances - Can I keep my own modded setup if I play Uranium Fever?
	- Yes. Uranium Fever is entirely self contained through the use of a Stock Game folder. As long as you have the appropriate Fallout installations (Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, and all DLCs) the installation will still work and will not interfere with your other modded setup.
- Size - Why is the installation requirement so large?
	- When Wabbajack compiles and installs a list, it requires simultaneously drive presence of the initial download, the unedited file, and the file after it has been altered (in our case, most large texture packs have been appropriately compressed, optimized, and BSA packed). Many of these files are automatically removed following installation, though if desired, around 50gb of download files can also be deleted. Deleting these download files will make updating more arduous, however.
- Start Location - Can I start in the Mojave Wasteland?
	- Yes. To start in the Mojave Wasteland, select "memory" when prompted "Is this now, or just a memory?" immediately after leaving the vault.
- Stock Game - What is the Stock Game Folder and why do I need it?
	- It is an installation of Fallout New Vegas that has already had several root mods installed. It also has the benefit of not altering the main Fallout New Vegas installation. Uranium Fever is entirely self contained in this respect.
- Ragdolls - Doesn't Ragdolls cause crashes?
	- No. The original version of ragdolls did cause crashes. The replacement plugin available in Death Throes is **NOT** prone to crashes.
- Vortex - Can I install Uranium Fever with vortex?
	- No. Wabbajack is inherently incompatible with vortex.
