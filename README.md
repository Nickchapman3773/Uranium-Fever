[!IMPORTANT]
***Thank you for helping test Uranium Fever!***

The following is a brief introduction to the list, though certainly not comprehensive. This document and Uranium Fever will undergo further revision prior to formal release.




Uranium Fever is a massive full-game overhaul and expansion of the worlds of Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3. Focused on a hardcore and compelling gameplay experience, this list represents a dramatic deviation from the vanilla experience. Every single mod and setting included in this list was thoroughly vetted by a team of experts in various different New Vegas modding domains. Very few aspects of the game remain untouched. We consider this the most cohesive, balanced, and mechanically interconnected Tale of Two Wastelands (TTW) experience. Enjoy!

- Vegas Elysium Perk Pack - A perk and trait pack that introduces a new cabinet and flaw systems, inspired by the game Disco Elysium. These new systems typically take the form of the player having a conflicting thought that initially provides a debuff, though after meeting certain criteria (coming across specific items, encounters, or taking a certain action enough times), the player is able to internalize the “answer” to the thought, ultimately providing a substantial buff. The text prompts in this mod are typically very colorful, adding a great deal of depth and fun to the game.

Highlighted Sound Mods:

- New Vegas Reloaded & Salamand3r's Helios Preset - A custom graphical extender that injects various new effects into the game. Helios utilizes this framework to make uniquely customized and independent world space visuals. This is, arguably, the most beautiful expression of the DC and Mojave Wastelands.
- Desert Natural Weathers - A complete overhaul of the weathers of both Wastelands with 360 panoramic cloud textures, improved lighting, and enhanced variation in rain, overcast, clear, snowy, and foggy weathers.
