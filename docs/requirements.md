:::important PATIENCE, COMPUTER EXPERIENCE, AND TIME ARE REQUIRED
Uranium Fever’s instructions are designed to be accessible for all users, regardless of modding experience. However, it is **REQUIRED** to thoroughly read each instruction, even if you consider yourself experienced enough to skip steps. While no prior modding knowledge is necessary, a general proficiency in computer operations is expected.
