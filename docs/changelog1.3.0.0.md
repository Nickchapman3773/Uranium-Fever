# <p align="center"> 1.3.0.0 - March 9, 2024</p>

**Removals:**
- Removed Combat Shotgun Reload Sounds Fix, redundant.
- Removed Gun Runners Kiosk Glass Fix, redundant.
- Removed Gauss Impact Fix, redundant.
- Removed MZ Fog Fix, redundant.
- Removed Impostors and LOD Flicker Fix, included in Goodies.
- Removed Swimming Creatures Fix, included in Goodies.
- Removed Clean AP and Health Bars, redundant.
- Removed Reset Settings Prompt, unnecessary given the ability to restore settings via Wabbajack.
- Removed B42 Notifications in favor of Smooth notifications.
- Removed No Cocking Sound on Rifle Equip, redundant.
- Removed Cooper Howard reference, unnecessary.
- Removed Climbable Ladders and associated patches, unnecessary.
- Removed Kaleidoscope, causing jarring LOD mismatch for little benefit.
- Removed Workbench Variation, unnecessary and sometimes jarring.
- Removed Portrait Gallery, unnecessary and sometimes jarring.
- Removed B42 Quickthrow and all associated patches. Another difficult decision, though this was done because of crashes associated with the mod and incompatibilities with Sweet’s throwable balance changes. Functionally replaced by Quick Select Throwables Patch.
- Removed Uncut Wasteland, Uncut Wasteland Extra Collection, New Vegas Uncut, and Misc Content Restoration and all associated patches in favor of Goodies.
- Removed More Mojave and Desert Landscapes in favor of the Dark versions.
- Removed 3DNPC - DC and associated patches. A difficult decision, though this was done due to extremely buggy companions and quests.
- Removed The Initiation, Eliza, Headhunting, The North Road, The Depths of Depravity, and The High Desert. Another difficult decision, and while these mods are extremely high quality, there were various reasons for removing these. They caused various conflicts with other mods that were difficult to resolve, had significant balance implications, and we felt the mods were not consistent with our vision of UF.
- Removed Citadel Overhaul and associated dependencies, as this mod had extremely poorly made navmeshes and was of overall questionable quality.
- Removed NCR Dialogue Expansion, questionable quality AI voicing.
- Removed various old DMT assets that were no longer necessary.
- Removed various old AGE assets that were no longer necessary.
- Removed Terminals Lock Up, replaced by an alternative.
- Removed Immersive Recoil in favor of B42 Recoil.
- Removed Viewmodel Recoil, extremely high performance overhead.
- Removed Repair Kit Clarity, redundant.
- Removed various unnecessary animated meshes, including decorations, Pyelon Wires, Utility Poles, Urban Buildings, Sorrows Shacks, Ranch House Panels, and all Animated and Illuminated Metro Signs and Kiosks.
- Removed Forbidden Zone Equations Restored, replaced by an addition.
- Removed Resplendent Rugs, replaced by an addition.
- Removed Casino Rugs HD, replaced by an addition.
- Removed Bloodbath, redundant.
- Removed B42 Optics and all associated patches. Another difficult decision, though this was done due to incompatibilities with NVR, various other bugs, and high performance demands. Functionally replaced by PSRO with Sneeze’s Overlay Overhaul.
- Removed Dramatic Inertia, jarring and made it feel like the player was on rollerskates.
- Removed 3rd Person - 10mm SMG Animations, as 3rd person is not the recommended camera view for combat.
- Removed kNVSE Fixpack, redundant.
- Removed Earthblighted Tunnelers replaced by an addition.
- Removed Fallout Texture Overhaul (FTO) - Robots, Eyebot and ED-E, replaced by an addition.
- Removed Prodlimens creature pack. Another difficult decision, though the creatures added by this pack were low quality textures and meshes, had questionable physics, and were occasionally implicated in crashes.
- Removed Ms Galtron - Classic Assaultron, felt jarring and out of place.
- Removed Wolfmeat Replacer and ED-E Backpack, which was mistakenly causing players to believe that they could carry items (which we have unsuccessfully attempted to implement in the past).
- Removed Height Randomizer, unnecessary.
- Removed Facial Asymmetry Distributor, unnecessary.
- Removed Pip-Boy - Mobile Pip Light, unnecessary and incompatible.
- Removed Pip-Boy - Counters, unnecessary.
- Removed Arefu LOD, combined with another LOD addition mod

**Changes:**

- Moved Immersive Minigame Tweaks to the Optional section, mainly to reduce questions and confusion pertaining to the use of the mod, though also to reduce script overhead for those not utilizing it.
- Moved Mod Delivery to the Optional section, primarily to reduce script overhead, considering this mod was egregiously underutilized.
- Moved 3rd Person Camera Overhaul to the Optional section, as this contributes to script overhead and is not the recommended camera view for general gameplay.
