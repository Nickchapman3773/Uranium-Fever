# <p align="center"> 1.3.0.1 - March 14, 2025</p>

**Removals:**
- Removed custom navmesh patch, an absolute pain to deal with.
- Removed Goodies - TTW Patch, in favor of RuyN21's - TTW Patch Hub

**Changes:**
- Disabled Power Armor training manuals in AWOP DC.
- Disabled save penalty, instead increasing the reload penalty.
