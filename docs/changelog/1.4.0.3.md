# <p align="center"> 1.4.0.3 - June 15, 2025 </p>

**Changes:**
- Reduced radiation intensity from Radstorms.
- Disabled bCompanionHitsCountAfterPlayerDamage and enabled bNoCompanionKillXP to impart the desired effect on companion related XP kills (the player must deal >40% damage to get XP from a kill).
- Slightly reduced sneak indicator radius and disabled it during combat.

**Fixes:**
- NVR shader optimizations have provided a fairly significant FPS improvement.
- Fixed permadeath not working correctly.
- Fixed inappropriate amounts of XP being removed when dying with Life After Death enabled (should have been 25 XP instead of 25% XP).
- Fixed Apocalyptic Storms delay to the degree possible; it will still cause storms immediately entering the Mojave Wasteland (simulates a 3 year time lapse), though it will no longer cause immediate storms upon entering the Capital Wasteland.
- Fixed crashes in the pip-boy stemming from Fast Travel Expenses.
- Fixed invisible rocks in Anchorage.
- Patched A Smoke Before the Storm cigarettes and Boiadero from Vegas Elysium.
