- **Application load error P:0000065432 - I am getting an error called Application load error P:0000065432. How do I fix it?**
  - Refer to the Steam PCR Users instructions in the [Configuring Game Settings](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/setupinstructions#-configuring-game-settings-) section.

- **Altering Uranium Fever - Can I modify mods in Uranium Fever?**
  - Official support is not provided for modified lists. However, the [uf-support-altered](https://discord.com/channels/1247305852738736219/1295564372978040906) channel on Discord allows community members to assist each other.

- **Cannibal Perk - Why doesn’t the cannibalize function from the Cannibal perk work?**
  - You must be crouching to use the cannibalize function.

- **Clean Install - Do I need a clean install of Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3 to use Uranium Fever?**
  - No. Uranium Fever is fully self-contained and independent of your regular Fallout installations!
 
- **Climbable Ladders - Can I climb any ladders in the game?**
  - The climbable ladder mod only affects water towers currently. To utilize this, look at the ladder and press the activate key to begin climbing. Once you are at the top press the activate key to get off the ladder.

- **Controller Support - Does Uranium Fever support controllers?**
  - Unfortunately, no. Creating a unified scheme for various equipment and platforms proved challenging. We recommend using Steam Input and this [Unofficial Controller Preset](https://discord.com/channels/1247305852738736219/1247325147950747699/1301652878703726612).

- **Crashing - My game crashes. How can I fix it?**
  - Post your crash log (located in `Uranium Fever > [NoDelete] Stock New Vegas > Crash Logs`) in the Uranium Fever Support channel on Discord.
  - If you’ve modified the list, use the modified Uranium Fever support channel. Note that altering Uranium Fever voids official support.

- **Dialogue Skill Indicator - Why don’t I see the skill check indicator in dialogue like in the original game?**
  - This feature has been intentionally removed to prevent players from knowing if they’ll pass a skill check.

- **Death, Reload, and Save Consequences - Can I disable Death, Reload, and Save Consequences? I do not understand why I am being charged to save and reload.***
  - Yes, you can disable this by disabling Death, Reload, and Save Consequences and Death, Reload, and Save Consequences - Uranium Fever Patch in the Mod Organizer 2 Optional Settings & Additions separator.
  - However, we consider this mod to be critical for well-balanced gameplay.
  - The philosophy behind this is that the player can easily save and reload games when preparing for difficulty scenarios, including combat, lockpicking, hacking, or other luck based scenarios, thus ensuring a perfect outcome.
  - To prevent the player from abusing this, a small cost (2.5% of total caps) has been imparted on creating quicksaves and reloading.
  - Automatic saves created by save manager (configured to every 60 seconds), saves created while exiting the game, and loads performed while starting the game are free.
  - This will force the player into unique scenarios they would otherwise avoid, such as fighting with a crippled arm, or continuing after the death of a companion.

- **DLCs - What levels are recommended for the DLCs and DLC-like quest mods?**
  - **Capital Wasteland:**
    - Point Lookout (with Early Decisions and Gameplay Enhancement) - 10
    - The Pitt - 15
    - Mothership Zeta (with Hardcore Zeta) - 25
    - Operation Anchorage (with Anchorage Gameplay Expansion) - 25
  - **Mojave Wasteland:**
    - Autumn Leaves - 1
    - Into the Deep - 10
    - Lake Havasu - 10
    - Dry Wells - 10
    - Honest Hearts - 10
    - The Initiation - 15
    - Old World Blues - 15
    - Eliza - 20
    - Headhunting - 20
    - Depths of Depravity - 20
    - The High Desert - 20
    - Dead Money (with Dead Money Tweaks) - 25
    - Lonesome Road - 25
    - North Road - 35

- **DMP Files - Mod Organizer 2 crashes on launch and opens 3 DMP files. Why?**
  - This is a result of outdated Runtimes. Instructions for updating are included in [Requirements](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/requirements).

- **Failed and Slow Nexus Downloads - Why are my downloads slow or failing?**
  - Make sure your Nexus account is connected to Wabbajack. Open Wabbajack settings to link your Nexus account.

- **Fallout 3 - Is Fallout 3 absolutely required to play Uranium Fever?**
  - Yes. There is no way to play Uranium Fever without owning Fallout 3 and the associated DLCs.

- **Fast Traveling - Can I fast travel in Uranium Fever?**
  - Yes. The only circumstances in which fast travel is prohibited is when over-encumbered or while in combat.

- **First Time Playing - Is this list suitable for a Fallout newcomer?**
  - Yes. This list is ideal for anyone seeking a challenging experience. If Uranium Fever feels overwhelming, consider other TTW/FNV Wabbajack lists.

- **First Time Playing - I want to experience the intro sequence.**
  - To experience the intro sequence, disbale the `Quick Start - Wasteland Starting Gear - Uranium Fever Merge Patch` mod in the Mod Organizer 2 `Optional Settings & Additions` separator. Please note the intro sequence is known to be associated with bugs, and we will not provide support for associated bugs.
 
- **First Time Playing - Do you have any tips on how to be successful?**
  - Avoid reducing any SPECIAL stat too low during character creation. No stat is useless in Uranium Fever, despite this being contrary to standard Fallout: New Vegas.
  - Choose two weapon skills to focus on at the start of the game. Ammo is scarce, as are skill points. Melee is powerful, though weapons break easily.
  - All perks and traits have been overhauled. Review their effect carefully, as they may have unintended consequences later on.
  - Trash is important. Scavenge for everything possible, as selling much of this will be important to gaining enough caps to afford food, ammo, and aid.
  - Empty bottles are invaluable for water collection.
  - Food will not provide much healing. The best ways to heal are by sleeping and by visiting doctors.
  - Chems and alcohol can give strong transient buffs, though are also associated with severe drawbacks during times of addiction. Visiting a doctor about the player's addiction will only help for a period of time while the player takes time to naturally recover from their addiction.
  - Some crafting items have unexpected uses. Study crafting stations carefully.
  - Challenges are a good source of XP.
  - Carry weapons requiring different ammo types. Ammo scarcity will require you to switch weapons frequently.
  - Do not consider the utility of certain weapons or items in standard Fallout: New Vegas or Fallout 3. Everything in Uranium Fever has been completely rebalanced, and weapons that were weak previously may now be much more useful.

- **Flickering - Why are distant objects or mountains flickering?**
  - This is called z-fighting. The only available mod to address this is not public and can cause issues like broken render distances.

- **FPS - How can I increase FPS in Uranium Fever?**
  - Consider trying [Lossless Scaling](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/losslessscalingguide). Please note that the Uranium Fever team has no affiliation with Lossless Scaling and does not provide support for it.
  - Try a lower quality [Uranium Fever Profile](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/setupinstructions/#-selecting-a-uranium-fever-profile-).

- **FPS Limiters - Do I need a separate FPS limiter?**
  - Yes. RTSS uses CPU functions to limit FPS, which offers lower latency and better consistency than GPU-based methods, especially in Fallout: New Vegas.

- **Hardcore - Can I disable hardcore mode?**
  - No. Many mods in Uranium Fever rely on hardcore mode, and the list is designed around it.

- **Healing - When I pay a doctor to heal me, I do not heal fully. Why?**
  - This is an intentional balance design. You will need to pay for several different healing sessions or heal through other means to fully heal.

- **HDR - The launcher is configured with HDR on, but my monitor doesn't support HDR. Should I turn it off?**
  - No, Fallout uses the term HDR to reference the quality of rendering, which is independent of your monitor.

- **Installation Error - I encountered an error during Wabbajack installation. What should I do?**
  - Simply rerun the installation; Wabbajack errors are often temporary.

- **Hacking - Why can’t I use the vanilla hacking mini-game?**
  - It’s replaced by Immersive Minigames, offering a balanced, resource-management-focused alternative.

- **Keybinds - How can I view Uranium Fever’s keybinds?**
  - Press `K` in the pause menu.

- **Launcher - My launcher only shows "Install" and "Options" is greyed out. Why?**
  - Re-run the launcher from Steam/GOG to regenerate the necessary INIs. This usually happens after updating Uranium Fever.

- **Level Cap - What is the level cap in Uranium Fever?**
  - 60, as set by Tale of Two Wastelands.

- **Long Load Screens - I have very long load screens, why?**
  - You likely capped your FPS at too low a value.

- **Lockpicking - Why can’t I use the vanilla lockpicking mini-game?**
  - It has been replaced by Immersive Minigames.

- **Manual Installs - Why must I manually install TTW and NVR?**
  - TTW requires manual installation due to ModPub restrictions, and NVR is locked behind Discord, which Wabbajack cannot access.

- **Mod Order/Load Order - I accidentally messed up my mod order/load order. How do I fix it?**
  - A backup is pre-bundled with Uranium Fever. You can either restore from the backup or re-run the Uranium Fever installer.

- **Modularity - Can I customize Uranium Fever to my preferences?**
  - Uranium Fever is not inherently modular. Due to optimizations, plugin merging, and updates, altered lists are unsupported.

- **NoDelete - What does [NoDelete] mean?**
  - This tag prevents Wabbajack from modifying the contents of tagged folders during updates.

- **Notification Size - Why are my notifications so large?**
  - Notification size is large at the start of a new game but will normalize after reloading.

- **NPCs - Why aren’t certain NPCs completing quest tasks?**
  - You may have interrupted their scripted actions. Reload a prior save and allow them to complete their tasks.

- **Optimization - How is Uranium Fever optimized?**
  - We used Cathedral Asset Optimizer and Nvidia Texture Tools to compress textures, downsize to 2k, and generate mipmaps. Animations are BSA-packed with BSArchPro, LOD distances are optimized, and priority flags are set to load only necessary items.

- **Other Modded Instances - Can I keep my other modded setups while playing Uranium Fever?**
  - Yes. Uranium Fever is self-contained in the Stock New Vegas folder and won’t interfere with other setups.

- **Pagefile - Should I increase the pagefile size for New Vegas?**
  - No. Fallout: New Vegas has a 3.9GB memory limit, so increasing the pagefile won’t prevent memory-related crashes.

- **Parse Errors - Are parse errors during installation an issue?**
  - No, as long as the installer shows "Complete" at the end.

- **Pink Screen - Why do I see pink transition screens?**
  - You likely skipped the 4GB patching process (`FNVPatch.exe` in `[NoDelete] Stock New Vegas`).

- **Plugin No Longer Present - I'm notified that certain plugins are missing. Is this an issue?**
  - No, unless specifically noted. Some plugins may be merged or removed during optimization, which doesn’t affect your save.

- **Quick Save - Why is there no quick save button?**
  - This is to prevent reloading to avoid negative outcomes in combat or skill checks.

- **Ragdolls - Does the Ragdolls mod cause crashes?**
  - No. The Death Throes plugin used here is stable.

- **Reflections - Why are landscape reflections visible in windows despite there being a building or object behind me?**
  - This is intentional and prevents significant performance loss.

- **Runtime Error - I’m getting a runtime error at launch.**
  - You likely opened MO2 before creating your Stock New Vegas folder. Re-run the Uranium Fever Installer to fix this.

- **Selecting Perks - Why can’t I select a perk every level?**
  - You can select perks only on even levels. Vegas Elysium requires the perk menu to display every level, even when perks aren’t available.

- **Size - Why is Uranium Fever so large?**
  - Despite optimizations, the list's texture enhancements are extensive, with original downloads alone requiring 50GB. See [Optional Clean Up](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/setupinstructions#-optional---enabling-the-performance-profile-) for ways to save space.
 
- **Start - How do I start in the Mojave Wasteland instead of the Capital Wasteland?**
  - Select "memory" when prompted after leaving the Vault 101 cave.

- **Tale of Two Wastelands - Is TTW required for Uranium Fever?**
  - Yes. The modlist cannot be installed or used without TTW.

- **Traits - I can choose 99 traits. Is this a bug?**
  - No, this is intentional behavior. Most traits have both benefits and downsides, which provide balance in having additional traits. Having the ability to have many traits provides ample opportunity for unique character experiences.

- **Ultra-wide - Can I use an ultra-wide resolution with Uranium Fever?**
  - We do not currently provide support for atypical aspect ratios, though plan to in the future.

- **VATS - Can I disable Bullet Time and enable VATS instead?**
  - No. VATS is very difficult to balance and is incompatible with mods included in Uranium Fever. All perks and traits are functional with Bullet Time, which is a superior skill-based alternative to VATS.

- **Updates - Will updating impact my saves?**
  - Unless specified otherwise, your saves will still work, though updates after starting a save may introduce small bugs.

- **XP - Sometimes I do not get XP when I kill enemies. Why?**
  - XP is reported collectively at the end of combat. If a companion kills a target, the player is not rewarded XP for the kill.
