:::danger Troubleshooting
For any installation errors or launch crashes, perform these steps:
- Verify ownership of supported versions of `Fallout: New Vegas`, `Fallout 3`, and all DLCs, as specified in [Requirements](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/requirements).
- Log out and back into Nexus within the Wabbajack client, as outlined in [Installing Uranium Fever](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/setupinstructions#-installing-uranium-fever-).
- Verify correct management of the Manual Downloads, as detailed in [Manual Downloads](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/setupinstructions/#-manual-downloads-).
- Confirm the required runtimes and frameworks are installed, per [Requirements](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/requirements).
- Restart your computer.
- Check that you have the correct version of DXVK, following [Intel iGPU Users and GPUs Without Vulkan Support - Downgrading DXVK](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/setupinstructions/#-intel-igpu-users-and-gpus-without-vulkan-support---downgrading-dxvk-).
- Re-run the Uranium Fever Wabbajack Installer. This process will repair errors and is much quicker than the initial installation.
- Ensure that the Tale of Two Wastelands’ filepath and mod size match the instructions in [Installing Tale of Two Wastelands (TTW)](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/setupinstructions/#-installing-tale-of-two-wastelands-ttw-).
- If issues persist, delete the `Uranium Fever` folder and restart the installation process from the beginning.
- For further help, refer to [Support, Feedback, & Updates](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/supportfeedback).

  - Follow the Steam PCR Users instructions in [Configuring Game Settings](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/setupinstructions#-configuring-game-settings-).

- **Altering Uranium Fever - Can I modify the mods?**
  - Modifying the list voids official support. Use the [uf-support-altered](https://discord.com/channels/1247305852738736219/1295564372978040906) Discord channel for community assistance.

- **Cannibal Perk - Why doesn’t the cannibalize perk work?**
  - Ensure you’re crouching to use the cannibalize feature.

- **Clean Install - Do I need a clean installation of Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3?**
  - No, Uranium Fever is fully self-contained and independent of your existing Fallout installations.

- **Climbable Ladders - Which ladders can I climb?**
  - Only water tower ladders are climbable. Look at the ladder and press the activate key to climb. Use the activate key again to dismount at the top.

- **Controller Support - Is there controller support?**

- **Crashing - How do I troubleshoot game crashes?**
  - If the troubleshooting steps above are insuffucient, share your crash log (found in `Uranium Fever > [NoDelete] Stock New Vegas > Crash Logs`) in the UF-support-unaltered Discord support channel.
  - For altered lists, use the modified Uranium Fever support channel.

- **Dialogue Skill Indicator - Why was it removed?**
  - This feature was intentionally removed to enhance immersion and prevent metagaming.

- **Death, Reload, and Save Consequences - Can I disable these?**
  - Yes, disable `Death, Reload, and Save Consequences` and `Quick Start - Wasteland Starting Gear - Uranium Fever Merge Patch` mod in the Mod Organizer 2 `Optional Settings & Additions` separator. However, this mechanic is considered integral to gameplay balance.

- **DLCs - What levels are recommended for the DLCs and DLC-like quest mods?**

  - **Capital Wasteland:**
    - **Point Lookout (with Early Decisions and Gameplay Enhancement)** - 10
    - **The Pitt** - 15

    - **Lonesome Road** - 25
    - **North Road** - 35

- **DMP Files - Mod Organizer 2 crashes on launch and opens 3 DMP files. Why?**  
  - This is a result of outdated Runtimes. Instructions for updating are included in [Requirements](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/requirements).

- **Failed and Slow Nexus Downloads - Why are my downloads slow or failing?**  
  - Relog into your Nexus account in the Wabbajack settings.

- **Fallout 3 - Is Fallout 3 absolutely required to play Uranium Fever?**  
  - Yes. There is no way to play Uranium Fever without owning Fallout 3 and the associated DLCs.

- **Fast Traveling - Can I fast travel in Uranium Fever?**  
  - Yes. The only circumstances in which fast travel is prohibited is when over-encumbered, while in combat, or while prohibited by quest content.

- **First Time Playing - Is this list suitable for a Fallout newcomer?**  
  - Yes. This list is ideal for anyone seeking a challenging experience. If Uranium Fever feels overwhelming, consider other TTW/FNV Wabbajack lists.

- **First Time Playing - I want to experience the intro sequence.**  
  - To experience the intro sequence, disable the `Quick Start - Wasteland Starting Gear - Uranium Fever Merge Patch` mod in the Mod Organizer 2 `Optional Settings & Additions` separator.  
  - Please note the intro sequence is known to be associated with bugs, and we will not provide support for these bugs.

- **First Time Playing - Do you have any tips on how to be successful?**  
  - Avoid reducing any SPECIAL stat too low during character creation. No stat is useless in Uranium Fever, despite this being contrary to standard Fallout: New Vegas.
  - Choose two weapon skills to focus on at the start of the game. Ammo is scarce, as are skill points. Melee is powerful, though weapons break easily.
  - All perks and traits have been overhauled. Review their effects carefully, as they may have unintended consequences later on.
  - Trash is important. Scavenge for everything possible. Selling trash will be important to gaining enough caps to afford food, ammo, and aid.
  - Empty bottles are invaluable for water collection.
  - Food will not provide much healing. The best ways to heal are by sleeping and by visiting doctors.
  - Chems and alcohol can give strong transient buffs, though are also associated with severe drawbacks during times of addiction. Visiting a doctor about the player's addiction will only help for a period of time while the player takes time to naturally recover from their addiction.
  - Some crafting items have unexpected uses. Study crafting stations carefully.
  - Challenges are a good source of XP.
  - Carry multiple weapons that require different ammo types. Ammo scarcity will require you to switch weapons frequently.
  - Forget any preconceptions of the utility of certain weapons or items in standard Fallout: New Vegas or Fallout 3. Everything in Uranium Fever has been completely rebalanced, and weapons that were weak previously may now be much more useful.

- **FPS - How can I increase FPS in Uranium Fever?**  
  - Consider trying [Lossless Scaling](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/losslessscalingguide).  
    Please note that the Uranium Fever team has no affiliation with Lossless Scaling and does not provide support for it.
  - Reduce the [Uranium Fever Profile](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/setupinstructions/#-selecting-a-uranium-fever-profile-) quality.

- **FPS Limiters - Do I need a separate FPS limiter?**  
  - Yes. RTSS utilizes CPU-based functions to limit FPS, which offers lower latency and better consistency than GPU-based methods, especially in Fallout: New Vegas.

- **Hardcore - Can I disable hardcore mode?**  
  - No. Many mods in Uranium Fever rely on hardcore mode, and the list is designed around it.

- **Healing - When I pay a doctor to heal me, I do not heal fully. Why?**  
  - This is an intentional balance design. You will need to pay for several different healing sessions or heal through other means to fully heal.

- **HDR - The launcher is configured with HDR on, but my monitor doesn't support HDR. Should I turn it off?**  
  - No, Fallout: New Vegas uses the term HDR to reference the quality of rendering, which is independent of your monitor.

- **Keybinds - How can I view Uranium Fever’s keybinds?**  
  - Press `K` in the pause menu.

- **Launcher - "Install" and "Options" is greyed out in the launcher. Why?**  
  - Re-run the launcher from Steam/GOG to regenerate the necessary INIs, then reopen the Uranium Fever Launcher. This can happen after updating Uranium Fever.

- **Level Cap - What is the level cap in Uranium Fever?**  
  - 60, as set by Tale of Two Wastelands.

- **Long Load Screens - I have very long load screens, why?**  
  - You likely capped your FPS at too low a value.

- **Manual Installs - Why must I manually install TTW and NVR?**  
  - TTW requires manual installation due to ModPub restrictions, and NVR is locked behind Discord, which Wabbajack cannot access.

- **Mod Order/Load Order - I accidentally messed up my mod order/load order. How do I fix it?**  
  - A backup is pre-bundled with Uranium Fever. You can either restore from the backup or re-run the Uranium Fever Wabbajack Installer, which will revert the modlist and load order to default configuration.

- **Modularity - Can I customize Uranium Fever to my preferences?**  
  - Uranium Fever is not inherently modular. Due to various complicated optimizations, plugin merges, and custom updates, altered lists are unsupported.

- **NoDelete - What does [NoDelete] mean?**  
  - This tag prevents Wabbajack from modifying the contents of tagged folders during updates.

- **Optimization - How is Uranium Fever optimized?**  
  - We used Cathedral Asset Optimizer and Nvidia Texture Tools to compress textures, downsize to 2k, and generate mipmaps. These are subsequently further adjusted by SNIFF when appropriate. Animations are compressed then BSA-packed with BSArchPro, LOD distances are optimized, and priority flags are set to load only necessary items.

- **Other Modded Instances - Can I keep my other modded setups while playing Uranium Fever?**  
  - Yes. Uranium Fever is self-contained in the Stock New Vegas folder and won’t interfere with other setups.

- **Overwolf - Can I use Overwolf with Uranium Fever?
  - No. Overwolf causes the game to crash.

- **Pagefile - Should I increase the pagefile size for New Vegas?**  
  - No. Fallout: New Vegas has a 3.9GB memory limit, meaning that the pagefile will not even be used prior to memory-related crashes.

- **Parse Errors - Are parse errors during installation an issue?**  
  - No, as long as the installer shows "Complete" at the end.

- **Pink Screen - Why do I see pink transition screens?**  
  - You likely skipped the 4GB patching process (`FNVPatch.exe` in `[NoDelete] Stock New Vegas`).

- **Plugin No Longer Present - I'm notified that certain plugins are missing. Is this an issue?**  
  - No, unless specifically noted. Some plugins may be merged or removed during optimization, which will not have a major impact on your save unless otherwise specified.

- **Ragdolls - Does the Ragdolls mod cause crashes?**  
  - No. The Death Throes replacement plugin used here is stable.

- **Reflections - Why are landscape reflections visible in windows despite there being a building or object behind me?**  
  - This is intentional to prevent significant performance degradation.

- **Runtime Error - I’m getting a runtime error at launch.**  
  - You likely opened MO2 before creating your Stock New Vegas folder. Re-run the Uranium Fever Wabbajack Installer to correct the error. This will repair any errors and will be much quicker than the initial installation.

- **Selecting Perks - Why can’t I select a perk every level?**  
  - You can only select perks on even levels. Vegas Elysium requires the perk menu to be displayed every level for appropriate functionality, even when perks aren’t available.

- **Shimmering Objects - Why do some objects shimmer?**  
  - This is an unfortunate consequence of the NVR PBR shader interacting with poorly made textures. Ideally, these textures will be gradually replaced.

- **Size - Why is Uranium Fever so large?**  
  - Despite optimizations, the list's texture enhancements are extensive, with original downloads alone requiring 50GB.

- **Start - How do I start in the Mojave Wasteland instead of the Capital Wasteland?**  
  - Select `memory` when prompted after leaving the Vault 101 cave.

- **Tale of Two Wastelands - Is TTW required for Uranium Fever?**  
  - Yes. The modlist cannot be installed or used without TTW.

- **Traits - I can choose 99 traits. Is this a bug?**  
  - No, this is intentional behavior. Most traits have both benefits and downsides, which provide balance in having additional traits. Having the ability to have many traits provides ample opportunity for unique character experiences.

- **Ultra-wide - Can I use an ultra-wide resolution with Uranium Fever?**  
  - We do not currently provide support for atypical aspect ratios, though plan to in the future.

- **VATS - Can I disable Bullet Time and enable VATS instead?**  
  - No. VATS is very difficult to balance and is inherently incompatible with other mods included in Uranium Fever. All perks and traits are functional with Bullet Time, which is a superior skill-based alternative to VATS.

- **Updates - Will updating impact my saves?**  
  - Unless specified otherwise, your saves will still work, though updates after starting a save may introduce small bugs.

- **XP - I do not always get XP when I kill enemies. Why?**  
  - XP is reported collectively at the end of combat and the player will not be rewarded XP for companion kills.
