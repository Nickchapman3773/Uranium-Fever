**Removals:**
- Removed Into The Deep - Optional Coco Sounds, no longer needed.
- Removed Fallout Texture Overhaul (FTO) - Robots - Sentry Bot, replaced with an alternative.
- Removed B42 - Inject Animations - Aid Addon due to unresolvable bugs.
- Removed Armed to the Teeth and associated patches due to unresolvable bugs.
- Removed Character Kit Remake Raiders Fix for IVMB - T4, which we felt was too clean and skimpy.

**Changes:**
- Disabled the Return to Sender perk from B42 Quickthrow for balance concerns.
- Disabled Talon Company and Regulator karma hit squads for balance concerns.
- Disabled Addiction Encounters in Immersive Fast Travel Encounters for immersion concerns.
- Enabled `Allow Weapon Hotkeys` and `PipBoy While Reloading` in Stewie’s Tweaks to promote additional gameplay options.
- Enabled `Hip Mode` in Weapon Based Hands Clip Distance to allow for tinkerers to adjust hip distance.
- Changed Scratch’s perk to give the player +5 to Survival for the basic version and +10 Survival for the upgraded version.
- Scratch no longer deals karma damage if you hit her. 
- Scratch is now mortal and can be killed. She was given a small health boost to compensate.
- Disabled Boop due to unresolvable bugs and immortality (a couple of quests have subsequently been removed).
- Made it possible to once again play the FO3 Opening sequence. To do this, disable Quick Start - Wasteland Starting Gear - Uranium Fever Merge Patch. We still recommend playing with this mod enabled.
- Clarified Quick Train message at beginning of the game.
- Moved Vendor Radio and Mod Radio to the Optional separator, which is now  disabled by default.
- Reverted to Dogmeat having no carry weight, we were unable to add carry weight in a non-buggy manner.
- Switched from Rockbiter to Hitman NVAO animations exclusively due to a bullet origin bug that was causing mesh collision.
- Patched FO3 and FNV 3DNPCs for follower’s formula redone. Scratch, the companion from Robot Dog Overhaul, and the companions from Overseer’s companions are still pending patching.

- Enabled Save Character Selector tweak.
- Added a local map hotkey (N).
- Added quick save and quick load hotkeys (Pgup, Pgdn). We felt these were reasonable to re-enable given the associated costs imparted by Death Consequences.
- Increased auto save interval to every 60 seconds to offset the cost for saving imparted by Death Consequences.
- Overhauled title screen, UI, and Pipboy, courtesy of DoktorAkcel and OrgasmicSneeze.
- Enabled ySI categories given associated fixes to this feature by Stentorious.

**Uranium Haze and Soft AF Updates:**
- Did a large scale overhaul of all facets of Uranium Haze.
    - Normalized tonemapping.
    - Redid interior brightness across the board. Caves and bunkers will be darker, houses and casinos will be brighter.
    - Completely redid night visuals in each worldspace. Focused on darkening nights so that the player will require a flashlight, but without contrast related abnormalities.
    - Made substantial miscellaneous fine-tuning adjustments to each worldspace.
    - Completely redid rain.
    - Completely redid roughness for the appearance of “wetness” in both terrain and PBR.
    - Reverted to Pip Light from the NVR flashlight shader. We are using an adjusted version to compliment intentionally dark areas.
    - Designed PBR settings, which will go live after the current NVR testing version goes live. This will serve to match objects to terrain, provide the feeling of “wetness” during rain, and further enhance interior preset variation.
- Soft AF:
    - Added fission batteries to metro animated kiosks and signs to enhance believability.
    - Fixed metro animated kiosk and sign glow.
    - Fixed inappropriate bison sign rotation.
    - Overhauled gomorrah exterior fire mesh.
    - Overhauled light beam meshes.
    - Added glow texture to strip light poles
    - Overhauled, improved, parallaxed, and PBR’d anchorage rock textures and meshes.
    - Overhauled all refuse piles.
    - Overhauled ant mounds.
    - Adjusted dust textures to be more immersive.
    - Overhauled muzzle flash for assault rifles.
    - Overhauled immersive pickup sounds.
    - Created the custom Pip Light used in Uranium Haze.
    - Added a UF specific initiating loading screen.

**Notes:**
- The climbable ladder mod only affects water towers at the moment, look at the ladder and press the activate key to begin climbing. Once you are at the top press the activate key to get off the ladder.

**Updating:**
- Please refer to the [Updating Uranium Fever](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/updating/) section for details on updating.

- Unless otherwise specified, all further updates will **NOT** require new saves.
- Altered or outdated lists will not be supported.
- Notifications of missing mods following updates are expected, not problematic, and related to merging of plugins.

- **UPDATING DXVK** - This is a critical manual step that must be followed. Manually download the new version of [DXVK](https://www.nexusmods.com/Core/Libs/Common/Widgets/DownloadPopUp?id=1000143106&game_id=130), extract it into the Uranium Fever > [NoDelete] Stock New Vegas folder, and select replace when prompted.
- Those with Nvidia graphics cards, be sure to update your drivers and repeat the [Nvidia Users - Applying Nvidia Profile](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/setupinstructions#-nvidia-users---applying-nvidia-profile-) steps after you update your drivers. This must be repeated every driver update, as Nvidia resets them during  updates.
