:::important Important Instructions
These instructions will reference the `game library folder`, which refers to the folder in which Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3 are installed.

Default locations for the `game library folder` include `C:\steam\steamapps\common` and `C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\Games`.
:::

- Step 1: Creating the Clean Stock New Vegas Folder
	- `Navigate` to the **CLEAN** `Fallout New Vegas` folder, which is located inside of the `game library folder`.
	- `Copy` **ALL** of the contents from inside of the `Fallout New Vegas` folder.
		- Click anywhere inside the `game library folder`, press `Ctrl+A` to highlight all files, then `Ctrl+C` to copy all files.
		- Click anywhere inside the `C:\Modding\Uranium Fever\[NoDelete] Stock New Vegas` folder and press `Ctrl+V` to paste the previously copied files.

- Step 2: Restoring Backups of Current Installs/Modded Instances
	- After successfully creating the `Clean Stock New Vegas folder`, `restore` the files that were previously backed up.
		- `Move` your `Fallout New Vegas` folder from your desktop back into `platform installation folder`, selecting `Replace` when prompted.
		- `Move` your `FalloutNV` folder from your desktop back into `C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\My Games`, selecting `Replace` when prompted.

- Step 3: Verifying Files in the Clean Stock New Vegas Folder
	- The clean [NoDelete] Stock New Vegas folder should now contain the following files (with or without the GECK files). If any **ADDITIONAL** files **NOT INCLUDED** in the follow screenshots are present within this folder, **DELETE** the [NoDelete] Stock New Vegas folder, re-run the `Installing Uranium Fever` step, then `start this section over`.
		- Steam - `[NoDelete] Stock New Vegas` file contents:
   
 			![Steam Stock](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c1c1d4c-6bc8-4289-99de-de90610f889d)

:::danger danger - No Extra Files
Extra files inside of the Stock New Vegas folder will result in an error when launching the game. These extra files are most often a byproduct of prior modded instances or playthroughs of Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas. As such, the above steps are **CRITICAL**.

Linux inherently requires above average operating system knowledge and troubleshooting capability. As such, these instructions are less specific. Support **WILL NOT** be provided for the Linux installation process.

- Requirements:
	- Windows - Access to windows via a seperate installation or a virtual machine.
 	- Lutris, Libstrangle, Steam, and SteamTinkerLaunch.

- Instructions: 
	- Follow the Uranium Fever Installation Instructions **ON WINDOWS** up until the `Disable Base Address Randomization` section.
	- `Copy` the `C:\Modding\Uranium Fever` folder to a temporary location on Linux.
	- `Open Lutris`, click the plus arrow, then search for and install `Fallout: New Vegas`.
		- Take note of the installation location.
		- `Test Fallout: New Vegas` to ensure it functions prior to proceeding.
	- `Install MO2` via `SteakTinkerLaunch`.
	- `Locate the SteamTinkerLaunch installation of MO2` and `copy its wine prefix folder over to Lutris'` **WITHOUT** overwriting any files.
	- In Lutris, right click Fallout: New Vegas, `duplicate its folder`, and `name it Uranium Fever`.
	- `Open the Uranium Fever installation winetricks`, click on `install a dll/component`, and `add lavfilters`. Then, `enable fontsmooth-rgb` in winetricks' settings.
	- `Move your Uranium Fever folder into the Fallout: New Vegas wine prefix folder`, preferably next to the Fallout: New Vegas folder.
	- Right click the Uranium Fever profile and:
		- In the `Runner Options tab` and `change the runner to wine-ge`.
 		- In the `Game Options tab` and `change the executable path` to the `modorganizer.exe` in the `Uranium Fever folder`.
  		- In the `System Options tab`, navigate to `environment tables` and `delete all entries`, instead adding `DXVK_STATE_CACHE disable`. **IF** using an AMD GPU with RADV drivers, also add `RADV_DEBUG noatocdithering`.
	- In command prefix, type `strangle 60`.
	- `Launch Uranium Fever` through Lutris to open MO2.
	- In MO2:
		- In the MO2 settings, navigate to `Paths`, then `Managed Games`. Ensure this path reflects the `Stock New Vegas folder`.
 		- Change the `Executable Path` for `Uranium Fever Launcher` and `Uranium Fever` to reflect the corresponding `executables in the Stock New Vegas folder`.
  		- Open `falloutcustom.ini` and `add iPresentInterval=0 under [Display]`.
	- Repeat the `Configuring Game Settings` section of the Windows installation instructions.
	- The game should now launch appropriately. Prior to starting a new game, open settings, then `Tweaks`, and `disable No Pip-Boy on Alt Tab`.

Caveats:
- MO2's Nexus Handler does not work. As Uranium Fever is updated, corresponding updates will need to be installed manually.
- Double clicking on a mod in MO2 causes MO2 to freeze. Because of this, mods must be edited manually from explorer.
- If problems are encountered, launch Lutris with debug output via the terminal by typing in lutris -d.
