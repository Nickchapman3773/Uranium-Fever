# <p align="center"> 1.1.1.0 - Dec 1, 2024 </p>

**Changes:**
- Enabled terminal failed on early exit in Stewieâ€™s Tweaks. With Terminals Lock UP, this should result in the difficulty going up on the terminal instead of locking out the terminal.
- Disabled Aim Collision Indicator during hipfire mode.
- Changed color scheme of Aim Collision Indicator to mirror UI colors.
- Changed JIP CCC companion portraits to be visible during combat or while selection is toggled.

**Additions:**
- Added Wordle Hack.
- Added Terminals Lock UP.

**Uranium Haze and Soft AF Updates:**
- Uranium Haze:
  - Updated to reflect the new 12/1/2024 nightly build of NVR.
  - Enabled PBR and leveraged it to amplify local brightness.
  - Enabled depth inversion by default. Z-fighting is now a thing of the past.
  - Enabled built-in fog remover, please remove the simple fog remover mod.

**Notes:**
- Some textures shimmer with the PBR shader enabled. This is due to flaws in the creation of the texture. Salamander is working to retexture the culprits.

**Updating:**
- Please refer to the [Updating Uranium Fever](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/updating/) guide for instructions.
- Updating from versions earlier than 1.0.0.0 requires a full reinstallations and new saves.
- Updates from 1.0.0.0 onward are save-safe unless otherwise specified.
- Altered or outdated lists will not be supported.
- Notifications of missing mods post-update are normal and reflect plugin merging.

- **CRITICAL**: For updates from pre-1.1.0.0 versions, review the 1.1.0.0 patch notes for DXVK update instructions.
- **CRITICAL**: For updates from pre-1.1.0.1 versions, review the 1.1.0.1 patch notes for NVR renaming instructions.

- **CRITICAL**: NVR must be updated to the new Nightly Build. To do so, repeat [Installing New Vegas Reloaded (NVR)](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/setupinstructions#-installing-new-vegas-reloaded-nvr-). After installing, open the Overwrite folder at the bottom of the Mod Organizer 2 modlist, and delete the Shaders folder.
