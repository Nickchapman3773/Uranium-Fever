**Uranium Fever** (UF) is a complete overhaul of Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3, focused on modernizing, expanding, rebalancing, and enhancing all aspects of both games. Designed for a hardcore gameplay experience, UF draws inspiration from renowned survival-horror titles like STALKER and Resident Evil. UF strives to integrate new content thoughtfully and rapidly. Every addition and configuration is carefully evaluated, and exclusive optimizations ensure stable performance despite the extensive modlist. We consider UF to be the most visually stunning, innovative, comprehensive, balanced, and cohesive Tale of Two Wastelands experience. Enjoy!

:::important What sets Uranium Fever apart from other modlists?
- UF is a community-driven project, enriched by contributions from some of the communityâ€™s most talented and knowledgeable mod authors, whose expertise and insights have been invaluable.
- UF has access to cutting-edge mods, often available even prior to their official release.
- UF includes numerous custom edits to enhance the player experience, such as adjustments to objects, NPCs, meshes, textures, navmeshes, collision markers, and roombounds.
- UF has been rigorously optimized, with custom enhancements not otherwise found in the modding community, allowing for exceptional performance despite the modlist's large size. Every mod asset has been evaluated and, when appropriate, reprocessed, downsized, compressed, mipmapped, and BSA-packed.
- Each new addition undergoes careful performance and memory testing to ensure UF remains stable and high-performing as it continues to evolve.
