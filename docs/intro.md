**Uranium Fever** (UF) is a comprehensive overhaul of all aspects of Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3, featuring modernization, content expansion, extensive rebalancing, and visual enhancement. Focused on a hardcore gameplay experience, UF draws inspiration from top survival-horror games such as STALKER and Resident Evil. UF is unique in that it integrates new content quickly and thoughtfully. Each inclusion and configuration is thoroughly evaluated, and innovative optimizations exclusive to UF ensure performance and stability despite the list's tremendous size. We consider UF to be the most stunning, innovative, comprehensive, balanced, and cohesive Tale of Two Wastelands experience. Enjoy!

:::important What differentiates Uranium Fever from other modlists?
- UF is a community initiative with contributions from many of the most talented and knowledgeable mod creators in the community. Their expertise and guidance have been fundamental in the creation of UF.
- UF has constant access to new, cutting-edge mods, often even before their formal release.
- UF contains countless custom edits to included mods to provide the highest quality and most seamless player experience possible. These edits include many adjusted object meshes, textures, navmeshes, collision markers, and roombounds.
- UF has been extensively optimized in ways not found elsewhere in the modding community, which provides UF with amazing performance despite being much larger and more comprehensive than otherwise possible. Every single mod asset included in UF has been evaluated and, when appropriate, reprocessed, downsized, compressed, mipmapped, and BSA packed.
- Careful performance and memory testing is performed alongside new additions to ensure performance and stability are never unexpectedly compromised, despite UF being ever-evolving.
