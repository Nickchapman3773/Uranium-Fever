**Uranium Fever** (UF) is a complete overhaul of Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3, with over 1300 mods focused on modernizing, expanding, rebalancing, and enhancing all aspects of both Wastelands. Designed for a hardcore gameplay experience, UF draws significant inspiration from acclaimed survival-horror titles like STALKER and Resident Evil. While remaining current with emerging content, every addition is carefully evaluated, customized, and seamlessly integrated with an emphasis on stability, performance, and balance. We consider UF to be the most visually stunning, innovative, comprehensive, well-balanced, and cohesive Tale of Two Wastelands experience available. Enjoy!

Large new additions are thoroughly memory tested to prevent degradation in performance as the list continues to evolve.
