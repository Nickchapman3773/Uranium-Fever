# <p align="center"> 1.2.0.0 - Dec 14, 2024 </p>

**Removals:**
- Removed Bullet Trails.
- Removed Bullet Trails - Subtler Version, both should have been removed a long time ago, as they are non-functional with non-hitscan projectiles and SWEEP makes gun projectiles non-hitscan.
- Removed Jacobstown Additions, interferes with super mutant weapon lists, edits several scripts it shouldn’t (to unclear ends), and has unvoiced dialogue.
- Removed MMTV MTB Sorting Addon in an attempt to further balance MTB.
- Removed Grass Remesh and the DXVK Transparency patch, as this mesh is extremely performance costly.
- Removed Stash Organizer, which was causing console null spam.
- Removed Assorted Leather Armor Retexture, replaced.
- Removed Chinese Stealth Armor - HiRes, replaced.
- Removed Physically Based Collections - Vending Machine in favor of vanilla mesh with reworked Ojo Bueno Vending Machine textures, thank you tanim574 for the suggestion.
- Removed 25mm Grenade APW Replacer - NVR Holosight Patch, no longer needed.
- Removed Immersive Pickup Sounds Patched, replaced.
- Removed Immersive Pickup Sounds - Patched - TTW Patch, replaced.
- Removed Lux Aeterna due to associated crashes in North Vegas.
- Removed Scratch and all of her associated patches due to reliable accessibility of the mod and various bugs. =’[

**Changes:**
- Edited the quest scripts for the Tranquility Lane section of the game to try and mitigate softlocks. Added a warning message as part of the quest advising players to do Tranquility Lane in one run and to not load saves made inside Tranquility Lane.
- Marked a couple Alien Epoxies in the Steamworks section of Zeta as persistent so that Famine won’t remove them for story consistency. 
- Changed the explosive used at the end of Spider’s quest in 3DNPC FO3 to a dummy mini nuke so the player can survive the explosion since they are locked in the area.
- Removed the Rivet City factions from the Rivet City guard in the holding cells on Zeta so that if the player kills them, they don’t lose fame with Rivet City (in space, no one can hear you scream).
- Re-enabled the TTW reflex sight for the Service Rifle and added it back to the appropriate lists. 
- With the addition of Repeatable Quests Rewards Rebalanced, repeatable quests have been nerfed to a degree we feel is appropriate and is Sweet approved. Some dialog will reference the vanilla rewards, we will try and fix this as it comes up if able.
- Further reduced density of grass, which will yield further benefits in terms of preventing stutter. This was done in a cascading fashion, with high quality having more grass than standard quality, and so forth.
- Increased the frequency of dismemberment.
- Adjusted the UI to better display weapon and armor condition, as well as ammo used, courtesy of Dok.
- Made a capital wasteland hideouts hardcore and distribution patch. Half of the hideouts are now available in the Mojave with appropriate distribution through the wasteland, they are now more difficult to access, no longer have free water, no longer have auto-sorting capabilities, and addiction removal stations removed, thanks for permission to do this MMTV!
- Made further title, load screen, and UI related adjustments for an overall smaller and sleeker aesthetic, utilizing XMLs from MUX (though not the majority of the mod), courtesy of Dok.	
- Adjusted various settings in Benny Humbles You to make the Mojave transition much more difficult (skills will now be fully reset, you will no longer get a 15% xp bonus, and you will not regain your special when you get the brainless perk).
- Transitioned to a custom Keybind Quick Display build that will allow me to specifically customize the order in which categories are presented, thanks Physics!
- DC Deathclaws will now look like FO4 Deathclaws and Mojave Deathclaws will use the Horrors of the New West meshes with a retexture.
- Gatorclaws have been added to Point Lookout, thanks MedRenace!
- Adjusted many Stewie Tweaks based on Sweets recommendations to promote balance or realism.
