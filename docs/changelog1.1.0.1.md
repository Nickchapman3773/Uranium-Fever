# <p align="center"> 1.1.0.1 - Nov 30, 2024 </p>

**Removals:**
- Removed Skip FO3 Outro due to inconsistencies it creates with end-game options.
- Removed Ownerless Trash, using a scripted alternative instead.

**Changes:**
- Screenshots will now universally appear in [NoDelete] Stock New Vegas > Screenshots. F12 takes screenshots with UI enabled, Left Shift + F12 takes screenshots with UI disabled.
- Overhauled Keybind Display to enhance clarity.
- Patched Robot Dog Overhaul for New Blood.
- Reenabled hit squads.

**Fixes:**
- Fixed crashing entering Pump Control at Project Purity.
- Fixed “That’s all I need” appearing in every NPCs dialog.
- Fixed several companion related settings not being appropriately applied.
- Fixed Death Consequences having cost associated with incremental full saves created by Save Manager.
- Fixed quick load not appropriately using the last created save.
- Fixed door collision related abnormalities, courtesy of Lime.
- Fixed errant 5-8 hotkeys.
- Fixed Scratch dealing karma damage to the player if she is hurt by enemy explosives.
- Fixed ladder and sewer grate issues
- Fixed service rifle and double-barrel shotgun animations.
- Fixed BOS robot dogs from Robot Dog Overhaul being hostile with other BOS robots. 
- Fixed Object conflict in Megaton Common House.
- Fixed Climbable Ladders not being properly merged. (Dark: Sorry. I had to rebuild the ESM 6 times in the update that we added them lol)
- Fixed Little Rock’s B42 Optics scope alignment.
- Fixed Standard Quality mistakenly having terrain PBR disabled instead of terrain parallax. This should yield ~10 FPS increase for standard quality users.
- Fixed reflective PL Submarine water.
- Fixed blown out Mobile Truck Base interior.
- Fixed extremely dark Mojave Outpost Barracks interior.

**Additions:**
- Created an additional performance profile. Low Quality is now called Very Low Quality, and the new iteration of Low Quality disabled only NVR and associated mods.
- Added an optional mod to mute main menu music.
- Added Auto-Equip Weapon if Unarmed
- Added Simple Scripted Trash Ownership Removal 

**Updating:**
- Please refer to the [Updating Uranium Fever](https://uraniumfever.net/docs/updating/) section for details on updating.
- Updating from versions prior to 1.0.0.0 REQUIRE full reinstallations and new saves 
- Updates AFTER 1.0.0.0 are SAVE-SAFE, and will remain so unless otherwise specified.
- Altered or outdated lists will not be supported.
- Notifications of missing mods following updates are expected, not problematic, and related to merging of plugins.

- **CRITICAL**: If updating from versions before 1.1.0.0, review the 1.1.0.0 patch notes for instructions on updating DXVK.
- **CRITICAL - PRIOR TO UPDATING**: Rename [NoDelete] NVR (LQ) to [NoDelete] NVR (VLQ) (LQ) **PRIOR TO UPDATING**. If you fail to do so and end up with two NVR mod folders, delete [NoDelete] NVR (VLQ) (LQ) and perform the aforementioned renaming step.
